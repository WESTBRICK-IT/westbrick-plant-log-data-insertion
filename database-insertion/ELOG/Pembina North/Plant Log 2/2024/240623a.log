<p>Confirm the shipping tank level with a temp gun</p>

<p>Paridise trucking hauled in a load of oil from 16-36</p>

<p>K-205 and K-202 both rang in with high temps but it was close to sundown and the temp return to normal</p>

<p>C3 fan shut down around 10 pm , hit a reset on the VFD because the C3 pressure was climbing , it ran for 20 min then shutdown again, left it down for the night</p>

<p>Change the water filters in the west pot. there were no holes and not that much for hydrocarbons on the top of the filters.</p>
