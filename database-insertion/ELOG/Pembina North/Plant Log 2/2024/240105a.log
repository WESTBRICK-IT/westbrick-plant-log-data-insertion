========================================
<p>Weather cool -10 in the morning warming to -5 in the afternoon</p>

<p>Added some glycol to the volcano boiler to 3 bolts form 2 bolts, walked the plant and checked for any glycol leaks, found nothing.</p>

<p>George out to talk about SSI</p>

<p>After lunch checked the volcano boiler level again and seen it had dropped in level again to l.5 bolts. Check through the plant again and found a leak on the heat tracing line on the main flare line south of the flare KO.</p>

<p>Blocked in the heat trace to stop the leak, immediately called Jarrod to inform him. Then called Bob K to inform him and it he said it was not a reportable spill.</p>

<p>Called RPM for a vac truck to clean up spill. (Still working at shift change)</p>

<p>Was informed by Jarrod not to touch the insulation on the flare line until a asbestos test is complete. Jarrod called Andrew with AHL Enviromental Service to come out and do the test. Should be on site around 6 pm</p>

<p>Inform Daren that he would be needed to repair the tubing line after the asbestos testing was complete and testing is negative.</p>

<p>Summited a Maximo event for the spill #37504</p>
