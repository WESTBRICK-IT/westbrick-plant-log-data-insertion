========================================
<p>Weather was cold lows in the-40</p>

<p>No security issues with the braz north site</p>

<p>Tank level was 3.84m and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Drain the inlet coalescer both sides.</p>

<p>steamer was on location at the start of shift had them working on the treater water dump line.</p>

<p>had them work on the dump line leaving the treater building.</p>

<p>We had them also steam the line going into the water injection building.</p>

<p>The treater still wasn&#39;t dumping. After that we sent the steamer home</p>

<p>I then took a baker pump with methanol in it to the treater dump line.</p>

<p>I pumped about 10L of methanol into and it pressured up,</p>

<p>Every hour I would go back down to treater and bump the pressure on the water dump line.</p>

<p>I did this until 3am but it stopped dropping the pressure and its staying pressured up to 1000kpa</p>

<p>taking the night shift truck in for a service its booked in on monday I&#39;ll&nbsp; pick the truck up on monday and bring it to work tuesday.</p>

<p>Pumped some methanol into the treater end of the water line did not exceed 1000kpa.&nbsp; need a truck which as of writing this at 15:30 have not heard back from anyone.</p>

<p>Submitted a hazard id in for treater water line #37706.</p>
