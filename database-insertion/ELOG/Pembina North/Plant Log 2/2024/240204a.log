<p>Weather cloudy and cool -6&nbsp;</p>

<p>V-3101 level still bouncing around between the top and bottom barrel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pulled 14-3 Pig, receiver full of hydrate materal. Notified Mark Spelrum and he will notifiy producers.</p>

<p>Verified the production tank level.</p>

<p>Started the methanol pump in process to inject methanol into the liquids line off V-3101, seem to work. Had to do this several times in the day to help V-3101 to dump</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on low suction one time.</p>

<p>Paradise hauled in 1 load of Westbrick emulsion</p>

<p>Swung recycle b pump into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Found a 8&quot; sink hole in the battery by the inlet header building. Marked the area off with caution tape and submitted a Maximo event. #38185</p>

<p>K-206 suction and bypass control are both on manual due to them fighting each other and making it difficult to suck the line pressures down.</p>

<p>Called Mark S twice to open up 8-24 esd.</p>
