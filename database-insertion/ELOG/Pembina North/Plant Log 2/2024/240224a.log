<p>Devin called out to fix trends at the beginning of shift.</p>

<p>Later that night the trends flat lined again and lost connection to the Zeta computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle stayed the night at Zeta.</p>

<p>Daren and Devin came out to see what was going on.&nbsp; Nothing found as the connesction came back before they arrived on site (after remote log in kicked them out).</p>
