========================================
<p>Tank level confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Drain K-203 suction scrubber</p>

<p>C3 fan rang in at 11:30 with a shutdown ,So I shut it off for the night</p>

<p>With&nbsp; tank level getting high 4.36m .I called pembina&nbsp; pipeline ,</p>

<p>The lady on shift told me that we have met our monthly allowables and we are cut back to 100m3 a day.</p>

<p>She did however pump another 50m3 for the day .</p>

<p>Westbrick should be calling pembina pipeline today to get allowables bumped up to a larger volume for the month</p>
