========================================
<p>Weather was warm and clear highs of 20</p>

<p>Tank level was 3.50m and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Started cleaning up the old barrel warehouse area</p>

<p>We had lewcam and some gravel trucks hauling in clay to fill the hole the old barrel warehouse left</p>

<p>Had a couple tank trucks come in today , the first truck empty 30m3 of water to the water truck in tank , that skimmed 28m3 over to the skim tank. the second truck empty 31m3 of fluid from the skim tank</p>

<p>We still have the truck in tank isolated from the tank the pumps pulls from.</p>

<p>We are still spilling over to the skim tank because we didn&#39;t get water from the skim tank yet only oil</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will have a couple of trucks coming out. We will skim the truck in water tank until we get water in the skim tank</p>

<p>Pembina pipeline was here to send a pig</p>

<p>Mark pigged the dominion line. He sent the pig at 10:30am. The pig came in at about 4pm&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brad pulled the drag around the yard</p>
