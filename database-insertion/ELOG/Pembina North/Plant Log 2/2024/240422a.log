<p>inlet to V-3101 cut back due to high liquid level while the pig was comming in, called Craig to pinck back at 5-21 to keep from tripping the 8-24 ESD on high pressure</p>

<p>V-101 gas to MP and V-103 inlet closed on manual to send all Vermilion gas to K204</p>

<p>K201 on line, k203 getting high oil temps</p>

<p>V-3101 inlet from Wolf creek on manual at 100% to keep it sfom pinching back while brining in extra gas</p>

<p>lowered PIC-3101 set point from 1000kpa to 990 to cut back the Dominion line to control the pressure on V-3101</p>

<p>K203 off line to change outboard valves on cyl 4 (Chris N), LOTO and SSI completed, SR 6093309</p>
