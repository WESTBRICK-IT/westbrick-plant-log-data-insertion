========================================
<p>Pembina Density at 08:30 was 763</p>

<p>Production tank still high, shut off recycle b pump to help slow down the level</p>

<p>Called Pembina control to start pump. Noms have been increased to 250m3/D until the end of the month</p>

<p>Restarted recycle b pump</p>

<p>Daren swapped both C3 fans so A fan is the leas and B fan is the lag. A fan output is set to not go over 90% to keep it running.</p>

========================================
<p>Confirm tank level with a temp gun</p>

<p>C3 fan rang in with low pressure and the 3104A fan shut off and the VFD needed to be reset in the MCC</p>

<p>After reseting the VFD the pressure dropped below 900 and it shut itself off again</p>

<p>K-205 jacket water high temp alarm rang in @88c , the tempture of the day was starting to cool off so it was left alone and it satisfied itself</p>

<p>Surge insterment crew was here they installed a fuel gas purge line into the boot</p>

<p>The plant had a slug of water hit around 7pm ,cut back the inlet on the 5-21 line for a few mins and everything leveled off</p>
