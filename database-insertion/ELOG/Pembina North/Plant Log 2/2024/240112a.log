<p>Weather:-40 in the morning warming to -30 in the afternoon</p>

<p>Plant down on mode 1 at the start of shift.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark S and Devon were on their way out.&nbsp; Found the ESD button loop had a loose connection.</p>

<p>Got things warming up around 8am.&nbsp;&nbsp; selling a bit of gas around 10am.&nbsp; Plant in normal operations at 15:30.</p>

<p>Issues starting K-202 and K-206.&nbsp; Clayton came out and repaired the lubricator block on K-206.&nbsp; K-202 had liquids sluggin in.</p>

<p>Safety system bypass forms were completed for the C3 compressor as it was having issues getting up to pressure on 2nd stage within the 2 minute permissive.</p>

<p>Safety system bypass filled out for ESD loop.&nbsp; Hazard ID entered as well.</p>

<p>Heaters in LPG building were not working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset breakers and are warming up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LPG pumps had a packing leak, Clayton replaced packing on pumps.</p>

<p>Pumps can be used if needed but building is cold and wanted to warm it up.&nbsp; Just need to rack the breakers.</p>

<p>Service requests were sent in for work done today.</p>
