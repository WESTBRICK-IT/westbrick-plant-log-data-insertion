========================================
<p>Previous shift having issues with V-3101 levels bouncing around and vessel not dumping</p>

<p>Called Tarpon (Mike) to come out and give us a hand troubleshooting and to calibrate V-3101 levels</p>

<p>Blocked in V-3101 dunp line, masked up and pulled the &quot;Y&quot; strainer. The &quot;Y&quot; strainer was completely plugged with black rubber and hydrate material, cleaned screen, pumped methanol into &quot;Y&quot; strainer back into V-3101 and through the coriolis meter. Also pumped methanol into V-3101 where it comes out of the ground</p>

<p>Tarpon (Mike) calibrated levels for V-3101, and the levels seem to be maintaining and were dumping okay now</p>

<p>Orion (Ken) hauled in a load of oil from Tangle Creek 13-16-49-11W5m</p>

<p>Iconic crew (Zach, Shane, Cody, Justin) here working on Key-Link project (Orientations x2)</p>

<p>Keyera (Grant and Stuart) stopped in to look at Key-Link project</p>

<p>Keyera (Mark S) here pigging the splitter line Braz to North Pem, Splitter from East Gas Gathering to 5-21 line, and waiting for a Pressure truck to pump methanol into 5-14 WPNE line</p>

<p>Justin work ordered the coriolis meter on V-3101, has not shown any flow since March 13/2018. W.O # 29183</p>

<p>Cleaning crew out today</p>

<p>Water plant comms fail this evening. Called Daren. Checked and there are no alarms at the Water Plant on the panel. Will run it for the night so Daren can reset the PLC tomorrow when maint is around.</p>
