========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Nelson Bros. (Wally) brought 4.5m3 of process water</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauling in Braz and Zeta water</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters on both pots, they run for 5 minutes then kick out on high differential. Water looks very oily, pulled samples from Braz, Zeta, and pump suction</p>

<p>Amine concentration at 35.2 %, lowered water make up from 12 down to 10</p>

<p>Tried to phone Pembina control all day, no luck, they started pumping us down late in the day</p>

<p>Re-cycled from the truck offload all afternoon, both pumps are now in the Production tank</p>
