========================================
<p>Cross shift went to Braz to start K-103</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler, seems to be plugged off</p>

<p>Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down V-101 sightglass</p>

<p>Glycol hanging up in the glycol separator</p>

<p>K-103 at Braz went down on underspeed</p>
