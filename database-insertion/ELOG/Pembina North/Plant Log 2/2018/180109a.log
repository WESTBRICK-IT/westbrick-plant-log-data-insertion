========================================
<p>&nbsp;Switched recycle pump b to truck offload</p>

<p>pinched louvers on the amine trim cooler &amp; lowered the tarps</p>

<p>pinched louvers on k202</p>

<p>05:00 hrs lost C3A on 2nd stage hi discharge, restarted, transmitter on propane accumilator reading incorrectly, psv went to flare, turned 2 speed fan to high, pressure started to drop &amp; psv closed, it was reading 550 kpa on the DCS &amp; 1600 kpa on the accumilator, needs checked.. when it went down, the suction control valve is most times on manaul at 100% open, pressure just spiked up causing it to shut down on discharge pressure.</p>

========================================
<p>Al out welding supports for the water charge pump</p>

<p>Night shift if water plant charge pump turns on please monitor.</p>

<p>-The c3 compressor went down&nbsp;2 times on high propane discharge pressure, we found the sensing line to the propane surge tank plugged off with oil. That caused the cooler louvers not to open and pressure up the c3.</p>

<p>-Tightened the packing on the plant eg pumps.</p>

<p>-Closed the louvers on the amine cooler.</p>

<p>-Dan repaired the west flare ko pump.</p>

<p>-Orion hauled in 1 load of Tangle Creek emulsion</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in 1 load of Baccaleau emulsion</p>

<p>-Blue River hauled in Obsidian condy</p>

<p>-Starting adding c3 to the system, still adding at shift change.</p>

<p>-Mike tubed in the east flare ko pump.</p>

<p>-Kevin T relocated the vibration transmitter at the water plant.</p>
