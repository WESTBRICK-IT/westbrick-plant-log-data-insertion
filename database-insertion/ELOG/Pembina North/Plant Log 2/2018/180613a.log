========================================
<p>Took the C3 and the Lean oil at the start of the shift</p>

<p>Called producers to let them know we were shutting in for a maintenance outage</p>

<p>Started shutting in inlets at 08:00 then took the plant down and brought the plant pressure down around 800kpa</p>

<p>Can Vac, and KeaBray out to open the flare line and soak it then suck it out (Lot of ashphaltines)</p>

<p>On start up had trouble to get the flare lit (Thanks Devin and Daren)</p>

<p>Also trouble with the hot oil heater, kept going down on low flow (Differential switch)</p>

<p>Changed out the Amine bag filter</p>

<p>Still bringing the plant online at shift change</p>
