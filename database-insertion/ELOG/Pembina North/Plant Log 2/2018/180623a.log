========================================
<p>Lost K-203 twice on compressor oil temp. Slowed it down abit more and sped up K-201 abit.</p>

<p>Sped up compression.</p>

<p>Glycol system did abit of a swing after loosing K-203. Flash tank hi leveled a couple times but manage to line out.</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol sep abit as there was no longer an interface in the sight glass.</p>

<p>Differential pressure on the chiller spiked up to 280 kpa and started to warm up. Cycled methanol pump twice and the DP dropped and cooled back off. All good.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; airlocked, fired back up and left in the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of Baccalieu oil from HVO.</p>

<p>Dallas was up at Braz shutting down saskatoon boiler, refridge and depressuring for T/A.</p>

========================================
<p>Lots of line pack. Called producers and kept them in the loop.</p>

<p>Sped up all compression as much as possible but was fighting with hi jacket water and compressor oil temps. ect. Was not able to speed up 203 till around 03:30 am.</p>

<p>Fired up K-208 to help out with pressures.</p>

<p>Increased the MP to LP makeup valve from 230 kpa to 280 kpa to help with MP pressures.</p>

<p>Pinched V-101 to MP header from 1340 kpa to 1400 kpa to send more gas to K-204.</p>

<p>Chiller differential pressure climed up to 400 kpa after speeding up compression and firing up K-208. Had to cycle methanol a couple times to bring the pressure down.</p>

<p>Screen plugged off on recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;. Cleaned.</p>

<p>Glycol level in the accumulator bouncing around. Flash tank and glycol sep levels controlling good. Lots of gas flow so it shouldnt be hanging up in the exchanger.</p>

<p>Contacted Pembina control center and got them to kick the pumps back on. BS&amp;W was less than 0.4 and stayed running.</p>

<p>Put recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; in the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Increased de-eth bottoms temp 4 degrees to lower the de-bute pressure.</p>

<p>Added oil to the LPG pump lubricators.</p>
