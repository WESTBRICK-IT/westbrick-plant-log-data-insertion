<p>Glycol rang in low level.&nbsp; Level bouncing all over.&nbsp; Reduced glycol flow rate to 8m3/day from 16m3/day till level came back.&nbsp; Set back to auto at 12m3/day.</p>

<p>Glycol seperator full through the sightglass with foamy glycol.&nbsp; Opened bypass and drained to regen.&nbsp; Blew down sightglass and float column.</p>
