<p>Vermillion bringing on 2-5-40-13 into the WPNE line</p>

<p>Brandon pulled the doors on cylinders # 2 and # 4 on the acid gas compressor, noticed oil leaks, put in some lapping compound, hopefully will fix our adding oil problem. Checked the oil level a few times, looks like it added on it&#39;s own and holding level. Thanks Brandon !!</p>
