<p>Recycle pumps sucking out of each tank. Nightshift can swing it in to the offload line after HVO is done hauling. Should be getting two more loads after shift change.</p>

<p>Increased de-eth bottoms temp from 100-104 to lower the c2 content.</p>

<p>Volcano heater running. Switched over to high fire after the temp warmed up. Nighshift please keep a lookout for any potential glycol leaks.</p>

<p>Kevin T put new lights in the volcano and V-200 building.</p>

<p>Devin N worked on h2s analyser pm&#39;s.</p>

<p>Added governor oil to K-205.</p>

<p>Taggart with Baker Hughes delivered SCW-6990 scale inhibitor and pumped it into the chemical tank.</p>
