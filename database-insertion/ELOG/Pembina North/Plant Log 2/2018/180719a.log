========================================
<p>Having a hard time getting the c3 loaded. Possibility of non condencables. Opened flare line off the top of the c3 cooler for approx 1 hour.</p>

<p>Lowered de eth bottoms temp three degrees due to tops temp being warm and reflux meter being pinned. Tops temp cooled down and reflux back down to around 100m3.</p>

<p>C3 compressor fully loaded after flaring off cooler and ambient temp cooling off.</p>

<p>Fired up lean oil pump and loaded to 140 m3 after process lined out.</p>

<p>Increased de eth bottoms temp after starting lean oil. Still slowly increasing.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump packing lubricator.</p>

<p>K-204 engine oil level good.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on recycle pump &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; as it was dripping.</p>

<p>Running steady.</p>
