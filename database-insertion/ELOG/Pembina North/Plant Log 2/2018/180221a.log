========================================
<p>E-3101 exchanger DP transmitter climed up to over 1100 kpa. Mike checked the two transmitters before and after the exchanger. The transmitter before the exchanger is the one that is out. Blew it down. Seems good. Will monitor.</p>

<p>Took appart K-204 level transmitter and pumped chemical through sensing lines. Mike changed the range on the transmitter.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>8-24 ESD checks.</p>

<p>Kevin T pulled out electric motor from the heater in the ambulance shack. Needs to be replaced as it was not kicking on.</p>

<p>Turned up the PAO-1001 chemical rate to 26L/day. As per Taggart.</p>

<p>Kevin T calibrated the failed LEL head in the acid gas compressor building.</p>

<p>Glycol sep was calling to dump but was not loosing level. Stroking the valve didnt help much.&nbsp; Pumped methanol backwards through the control valve. All good.</p>

<p>Equalized the reclimation tank a little bit.</p>

<p>Film pig is still stuck somewhere in the WPNE line. The well that pushes it is currently down with some wax issues and will hopefully be flowing tomorrow. Mark Spelrem is working with Vermilion operations on it.</p>
