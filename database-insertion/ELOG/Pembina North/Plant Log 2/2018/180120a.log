========================================
<p>Put both recycles in the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in 1 load of Tangle creek emulsion.</p>

<p>2 speed fan on slow.</p>

<p>Around 2am Cynthia Electric drive comp went down due to power issues, loosing all inlet compression.&nbsp; So....</p>

<p>Chris started K-102 at Braz.</p>

<p>On V-3101 set the inlet control on the 5-21 line to 1100kpa from 1800kpa.</p>

<p>On V-101 increased the pressure to K-206 to 1600kpa from 1400kpa.</p>

<p>Increased K-206 suction pressure to 950 from 900 to keep the valve from hunting.</p>

<p>Decreased Amine reboiler temp valve by 1% to reduce reflux and to see if it will increase top temps.</p>

========================================
<p>Continued with Cynthia being down, taking all of Bigoray gas we could, opened inlets, adjusted for pressures all day, still high flows at end of shift. Above 800e3m3 most of the day?! woot woot</p>

<p>Started K-208 sped up K-201</p>

<p>Field Kenny, pigged the wolf creek14-03 before he called to let us know, otherwise would have had him hold off due to gas flows, pig was sent at 09:00 hrs, hit the plant with liquids at 15:00 hrs, lots of liquids &amp; still slugging in at end of shift</p>

<p>Vermillion had a couple wells loaded up that were shut in, they wanted to let the pressure shut the wells down that were flowing in on the north inlet(V101) just to get the two wells unloaded, lots of flow hitting over 300 dec&#39;s, controled at about 220-250 dec&#39;s, but recieved lots of liquids as well</p>

<p>V101 meter FQI-3007(Bigoray offload) blocked in manaul valve due to showing flow</p>

<p>V200 raised back pressure from 200 to 280 kPa to let pump run.</p>

<p>Water Flash high leveled, opened fuel gas to water flash shut flare, increased pressure to 750 kpa, it is slowing pumping in with V3101, flare control was set at 600 on the dial.</p>

<p>Recycle pump B down to help with liquids</p>

<p>Recieved oil from :</p>

<p>HVO Baccilieau one load</p>

<p>Orion Tangle Creek one load</p>
