========================================
<p>Sped up compression.</p>

<p>Shut down K-201 and fired up K-203 in HP mode.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump lubricators.</p>

<p>Can not keep a level in the glycol accumulator. Seemed to start after speeding up compression. Glycol sep level looks good. Flash tank is not dumping properly. Slowly building a level. Bypassed filters with no luck. Pumped through control valve with baker pump and added a little pressure to the flash tank. May have helped abit.</p>

<p>Lots of hydrocarbon in glycol flash tank. Skimmed. Still some hydrocarbon but looks much better.</p>

<p>Glycol filters are still currently bypassed.</p>

<p>Adjusted de-eth temps.</p>
