========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter, and blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Added Meropa 220 oil to the Amine charge pump</p>

<p>Pinched in the louvers on K-208 and K-202 this morning, opened again this afternoon</p>

<p>Romeo snugged up the packing on K-203 4th stage volume pocket (it was leaking slightly)</p>

<p>Water well was out 50m3, verified meters, and both reading close 316m3 vs 318m3</p>

<p>Having a hard time with glycol returns, changed out the filters in the south pot and put the north pot in service</p>

<p>GGT (Jason) hauling in Braz and Zeta Creek water, also emptied the skim tank at the water well back through the mass meter (.3 on the gauge was 10m3)</p>

<p>HVO (Shane) hauling in two loads of Baccalieu oil from 6-16-49-11W5m</p>

<p>Obsidian (Kim) sent pigs on the PNA and 1-21 lines, will pull the pigs tomorrow</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricators</p>

<p>Recycle pumps are in the production and truck offload lines</p>
