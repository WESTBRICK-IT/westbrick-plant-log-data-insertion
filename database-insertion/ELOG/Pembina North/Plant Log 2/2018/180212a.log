========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Added propane to the C3 accumulator, started at 3 bolts, finished at 8 bolts</p>

<p>Ordered 6m3 of process water from Nelson Bros. to deliver on Wednesday Feb 14th</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-201 and K-202</p>

<p>WPNA line seems to be froze off, running WPNA through the pig trap through PNA line</p>

<p>Replaced the carseal # 107 for WPNA by-pass around the ESD</p>

<p>Obsidian (Shane) and KPA (Brenda) here to put some methanol into the WPNA line from the inlet header to V-200. Seems to be flowing now, will monitor the rest of the day</p>

<p>Strata Controls (Corby and Sterling) here to calibrate the mass flow meter</p>

<p>GGT (Jason) taking a load of oil from the sales tank to pump through the mass flow meter for calibration, also hauling in Zeta Creek water</p>

<p>HVO (Bill) hauling in Baccalieu oil from 16-18-48-12 W5m</p>

<p>Work ordered the WPNA line to be insulated from the inlet header building to V-200 W.O. # 28660</p>

<p>Orion (Ken) hauled in a load of oil from Tangle Creek</p>

<p>V-101 swinging, getting lots of liquids,then closing inlet. Raised back pressure controller to MP header to 1500 kpa and running the inlet controller in manual to keep from swinging, and lowered the liquid dump set points</p>
