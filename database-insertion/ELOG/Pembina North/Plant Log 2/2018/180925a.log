<p>Scoped out 1-21 4&quot; piping chem wash project with Ken L, will be switching 1-21 back to V3101 for two days, Ken &amp; crew will be installing launcher &amp; reciever on the 4&quot; line that runs from inlets on the hill down to where it comes up by sales south end of annex. they will be sending a pig thru the line then pumping chemical in to sit for 2 days, pig it out again. Reason for this is there is thought to be some build up of wax causing restriction in the line. Hope is- it lowers the flow pressure for the future possibility of Vermillion coming in on that line from the top of hill. They recently added flow to the line &amp; found a 120 kpa diff, when running the numbers thru Justin, his figure came out at&nbsp;90 kpa diff.</p>
