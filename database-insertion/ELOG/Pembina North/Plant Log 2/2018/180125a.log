<p>Justin, Tye, and Jason stayed late to help out with the swap over of Bigoray offgload gas. Shut down K-208, shut down K-205 and swapped sales gas over to K-204</p>

<p>HVO (Al) hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil from 15-10-48-12 W5m</p>

<p>Shut down K-201</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-202</p>

<p>Plowed snow all night</p>

<p>K-103 down at Braz, high discharge pressure. K-104 same thing high discharge pressure, suspect the VHP exchanger is froze off, flaring through VHP sales header relief to flare. Blaine on his way out. Jeff will try and get some methanol into the exchanger</p>

<p>Water flash tank high levelled and would not pump, same time Jeff went to Braz, Put in a W.O. for the pump W.O. # 28456 this pump is a piece of junk with only 3/4&quot; tubing for discharge, and 14,&nbsp; 90 degree elbows in a 30 foot run</p>

<p>Tried to re-submit the ERP manual for the night shift truck. Would not accept the ERP # and their help desk is closed. Justin can you try and submit it today (Thanks)</p>
