========================================
<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler after yesterdays warm up. Lots of lube oil.</p>

<p>Glycol sperator sight glass interface was not visible. Glycol looked milky and foamy in sight glass. However glycol accumulator and flash tank level was fairly steady. Monitored it. Stroked glycol sep dump valve. No luck. Had to open bypass around dump valve.</p>

<p>End of the night the glycol sep was still having a hard time maintaining level. Pumped methanol through the level control valve and cycled it a bunch. Started dumping and maintaining proper level. Flash tank handled the slug fine. Dayshift please monitor glycol sep level.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump packing lubricator.</p>

<p>Plant ran steady.</p>
