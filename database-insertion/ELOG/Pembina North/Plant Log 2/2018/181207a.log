========================================
<p>&nbsp;Pinched louvers on k203, 202, &amp; 208</p>

<p>Sale&#39;s analyzer low tape alarmed, should be good for day or so</p>

<p>C3 cooler west fan&nbsp;chattering&nbsp;Dayshift have mechanic have a look</p>

<p>Recycle pump B still in truckoff load</p>

<p>Glycol regen level up &amp; down, added a bit of new, then stroked glycol sep dump valve couple times started getting level.</p>

<p>K206 down on scrubber level, restarted</p>

<p>K208 at the same time 206 went down</p>

<p>V101 gas flow up &amp; down, lots of liquids at times</p>

<p>K204 scrubber level, would not dump, used bakker pump to break, blew down several times, &nbsp;still reading level but not shutting down compressor, blew down hi level column, lost compressor in the process, restarted.</p>

========================================
<p>K-206, 204 were down on hi scrubber level this AM&nbsp;due to a false level in V-101. K-208 also down due to low gas flow.</p>

<p>Blew down capilaries on V-101 to get the level reading properly so it would dump. As it was carrying liquids over to compression. Then got compression running.</p>

<p>Pumped up sight glass and sensing line with PAO-1001 chemical to break up potential wax causing the issues. So far so good. Will have to keep an eye on it overnight.</p>

<p>Lean oil pump vapour locked this AM after upset due to false level. Blew down sensing lines and pumped up the wet leg and got it reading accurate. Had to blow discharge to flare to get the pump to grab suction. Increased the rate back up to 140 m/day.</p>

<p>Slowly increasing the de-eth bottoms temp as needed to maintain spec ect.</p>

<p>Devin and Daren got&nbsp;the top louvers working on the debute cooler fans to properly maintain 900 kpa pressure setpoint.</p>

<p>Inlet coalescer dump controller float was sticking open. Pulled cap off of the column and cleaned it out internally to free up the float. Put back together and set up the controller. Keep an eye on it incase it sticks open.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT hauled in Braz and zeta water.</p>

<p>Started weekend checks.</p>

<p>Changed the tape on the sales analyser.</p>

<p>Kevin went up to Zeta this am to cross train.</p>

<p>Blew down FQI-99 multiple times due to V-101 gas to K-204 flow rate reading unaccurate. Got a little bit of liquids the first time, however it didnt seem to help.</p>

<p>The chattering noise on the cooler seems to be from when they are closed all the way to maintain surge tank pressure the fans push more air causing them to rattle the louvers abit. May need to turn a fan off.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Devin got K-202 and K-208 chemical pumps pumping again. Had to replace a passing ball valve and two check valves.</p>
