========================================
<p>-Added oil to k206 and k205 lubricators.</p>

<p>-Filled the lpg&nbsp;lubricator</p>

<p>-Opened up louvers on K202 and k208</p>

<p>-Pembina out and batch their monthly biocide.</p>

<p>-Obsidian pigged wpna. Pig is in and will pull tomorrow.</p>

<p>-Checked for 5-14 pig again and still nothing, let Mark Spelrem know.</p>

<p>-Lost K204 on high dischage temp, it looks&nbsp;like Vermillian has some production down and the compressor was starving. Slowed it&nbsp;down to 700 rpm</p>

<p>-Cut back the hot oil flow to the heating coil in the amine packing drain&nbsp;tank under the skid, it&nbsp;was boiling hard and making lots of steam.</p>

<p>&nbsp;-Devin worked on V101 level capileries, he found nothing wrong.</p>
