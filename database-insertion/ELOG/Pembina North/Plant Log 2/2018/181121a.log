========================================
<p>Swapped recycle to truck offload.</p>

<p>2 loads of Baccalieu hauled in.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>Avalanche out to do UT scanning in Process.</p>

<p>Romeo changed water plant filters, now running 10 micron.</p>

<p>Ordered more process water and it was delivered today.</p>

<p>Propane tanks filled up for the plant and water well.</p>

<p>Mancal pigged into V103 lots of fluid.</p>

<p>Safety and maitenance meeting.</p>

<p>Tyson fixed the Amine anti foam pump.</p>

<p>Lost K205 again nothing flagged.</p>

<p>De Eth refluxing too much, played with temps and still around 200m3/d, so cut back the lean oil to 120m3/d and lowered the bottoms temp to 93 on the De Eth.&nbsp; Night shift can play with it if they have time.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator.</p>

<p>At Braz Dayton found V-102 going sour, called Devin over to calibrate LP h2s monitor.&nbsp; It wouldnt calibrate but is online anyways.&nbsp; Wade came out and fixed the scavenger pump and trippled the rate brought on V102.&nbsp; Please monitor.</p>

========================================
<p>Rob with GGT finished offloading Braz water.</p>

<p>Lowered the bottoms temp on the de-eth to 93 degrees from 95 degrees as the reflux flow meter was pinned. Got GC saying 0% ethane for awhile at 93 degrees. Slowly started increasing lean oil flow rate and de-eth bottoms temp. Currently at 145m/day and 95 degrees will increase accordingly.</p>

<p>Glycol accumulator level dropped to around 30% at start of shift. Shortly after level came back aggresivly. Glycol in glycol sep looking very foamy and milky. Manually dumped a few times very slowly to not overwhealm the flash tank ect and managed to get the accumulator to start maintaing level.&nbsp; Did not cycle the methanol as that may be the culprit of the upset?</p>

<p>Pumped a little methanol back through glycol sep dump valve and stroked valve. Seemed to help it dump abit more steady.</p>

<p>Glycol back to normal around 04:00AM.</p>

<p>Steady night, plant ran good otherwise.</p>
