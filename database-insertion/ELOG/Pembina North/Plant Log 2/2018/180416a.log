========================================
<p>- Added Meropa 220 oil to amine charge pump</p>

<p>- Amine conc 34% and cloudy. Amine reboiler has 2 bolts of oil. Slowed down amine charge pump from 15% to 10% to stop picking up hydrocarbons (as per the cloudiness and oil)</p>

<p>- Amine make up pump truned down from 12% to 10%. Want to get the reboiler level low enough to just skim the oil, to stop reboiler level from slowly climbing, stop conc from going down.</p>

<p>- Dan repaired C3 suction scrubber pump</p>

<p>- Core labs out taking weekly samples</p>

<p>- GGT hauled 5 loads of Zeta water</p>

<p>- Boot relief to flare was slighlty opening. Adjusted LP to Boot make up on K-202</p>

<p>- Mike M fixed the leaking soleniod on K-203</p>

<p>- Kevin T calibrated the AG Comp LEL head</p>

<p>- HVO hauled one load of Baccalieu oil</p>
