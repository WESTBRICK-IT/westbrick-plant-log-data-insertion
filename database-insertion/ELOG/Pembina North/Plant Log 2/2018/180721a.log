========================================
<p>Topped up LPG pumps.</p>

<p>Kenny pigged 14-3 line.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT haulled in Braz &amp; Zeta water, sucked out lube oil barrel in the LPG building, sucked out the skid drain tank on the Acid Gas compressor.</p>

<p>Shut down k-201.</p>

<p>K-203 went down when Idling it up after shutting k-201 down, restarted it and it is running fine.</p>

<p>C3 compressor went down on High suction scrubber level (according to panel), panel wouldn&#39;t reset, called out Daren Fald to diagnose the issue, turned out to be a blown fuse in the MCC.</p>

<p>Found an air line leaking in the process building, hooked up a temporary air hose up to the controller, please do not disconnect, it controls the suction of the C3 and Hot gas bypass.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on recycle pump A, packing was crooked so I tightened the bottom side a bit to straighten it out, please monitor.</p>

<p>Added oil to the acid gas compressor.</p>
