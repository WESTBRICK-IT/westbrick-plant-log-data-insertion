========================================
<p>Increased de-eth temp to 99 degrees after c3 compressor was fully loaded and suction valve was 100% open. Reflux meter was almost pinned on de-eth. Lowered temp to 97 degrees. Still refluxing alot (190-210 m3/day). Ethane spec was hanging around 2.00% to 2.75%. Was going to leave there and let it line out but ethane content started to climb around 02:30 AM. Increased de-eth bottoms temp back up to 99.</p>

<p>Swung into the West filter pot in the water plant due to hi DP.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT finished hauling Braz water.</p>

<p>Plant ran steady.</p>
