<p>Lowered the De-eth reboiler temp from 102 to 100</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">Closed the valve from gas gathering to the De-eth overhead scrubber, also swung the De-eth overhead gas (FQI-3105) straight to sales. This helped with plant inlet pressures, V-3101 pressures, De-eth, De-but pressures, C3 motor load. However increased our Sales H2s ppm&#39;s</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">The above mentioned changes are switched back to their original positions. (Due to poor wording on CSO #33)</span></p>
