========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Got a little oil.</p>

<p>Drained A LOT of lube oils off the bottom of the chiller.</p>

<p>Blew down glycol separator sightglass and lowered level a little.</p>

<p>Increased tops temp controller to 42% from 40% to help increase reflux rate.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-203 to help increase amine contactor inlet temp, and lowered K-204 louver set points to help cool inlet temps to chiller.</p>

<p>Swung Recycle pump B into the overflow.</p>

<p>Put K-205 into manual and speed up to 890 RPM.&nbsp; Could only get 860 running in auto with pressure controller maxed out.</p>

<p>Increased amine make-up water to 16 from 12.&nbsp; Reboiler level sitting around 40%.</p>

<p>Put K-204 recycle into manual at 0 as it was opening and closing from 0% to 2% in auto. Shot temp on the valve and it was not passing in manual. Left in manual for now. Notified Mike.</p>

<p>Started SVI&#39;s for the keylink tie in project</p>

<p>Iconic and Lazer out to work on the wiring for the keylink project at the LPG building, site specific orientation for the 2 welders from Lazer</p>

<p>Checked the LPG pump pulsation dampner with Dan this morning. Bladder is NFG. Dan oredered parts.</p>

<p>Called Bigoray to confirm that they will be taking their gas back tomorrow morning</p>

<p>Created LOTO for the truck offload job down at the LPG building</p>

<p>Changed valves on K-204 Cyl 1 (Discharge only) the valves were fine. Cyl 1/3 discharge diff temp was ringing in. Called Dan to verify it was ok to raise the shutdown temp and he gave us the go ahead. Increased alarm temp from 8 to 10 C and increased shut down from 10 to 12 C</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Dane / Jayson found Acid Gas Dis ESD was leaking a bit. Needs servicing. Darkai service tag on the valve.</strong></span></p>

<p>Tightened the packing on recycle pump B</p>

<p>Jayson manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber</p>

<p>Dan pumped dye into K-206 glycol for leak testing tomorrow</p>

<p>GGT hauled 7 loads of water (Braz 3 - Zeta 4)</p>

<p>Water plant charge pump started hammering again once the well pressure come up to 4000 Kpa. Shut down the charge pump at the hand switch and set the overide so the booster pumps would continue to pump the level down over night.</p>
