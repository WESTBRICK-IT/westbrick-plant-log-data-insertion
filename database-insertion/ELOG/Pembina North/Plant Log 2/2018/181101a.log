<p>&nbsp;-Shut down k202 and Tyson replaced both inboard discharge valves on cyl 1, plates broke in both valves.</p>

<p>-Hvo delivered 1 load of Baccaleau oil</p>

<p>-Amine regen still bounceing around, tried adding some anti form a couple of times but it didn&#39;t seem to help much.</p>

<p>-Two wash/metal bins got delivered to the bone yard for the scrap metal.</p>

<p>-Increased the debut fan speed to 20%</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter.</p>
