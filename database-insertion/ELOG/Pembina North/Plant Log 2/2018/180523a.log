<p>On the way back to the office from starting K-205 I noticed smoke coming from west of the process building.&nbsp;&nbsp; I grabbed 2 water packs from the safety shack, and called Jeff on the radio for help.&nbsp;&nbsp; Started to put out the small grass fire, Jeff showed up to help.&nbsp; Notified Raymond and he came out.&nbsp; KITS submitted.</p>
