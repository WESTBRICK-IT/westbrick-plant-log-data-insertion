<p>Shut down K-202 for a bit today so Brandon could adjust some interna louvers.&nbsp; Ran K-208 in the mean time.</p>

<p>Devin worked on louvers today, on all comps.</p>

<p>Pinchin did a noise and BTEX survey.</p>

<p>Shut down lean oil due to high temps and load on the chiller.</p>

<p>Kevin replaced UPS in the old MCC, and out a new piece of metal behind the vibration switch on &quot;A&quot; C3 comp.</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on engine oil temp at the end of the day and had another incident.</p>
