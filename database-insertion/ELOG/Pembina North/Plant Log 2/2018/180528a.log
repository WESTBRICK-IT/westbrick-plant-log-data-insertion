<p>Devin working on 6-23 ESD.</p>

<p>Keylink called and will be lowering the pipeline pressure to test their shutdowns.</p>

<p>Training with Kyle.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-202 compressor due to oil temps.</p>

<p>Discharge valve after pressure transmitter on keylink skid is pinched in to keep pressure on pumps. Also the presco needle valve is blocked in to hold pressure on presco to prevent the ESD from closing due to low line pressure. As per Jim Garrison. He also wants instrumentation to change the low low pressure reset to around 500-700 KPA. Currently its over 1500 KPA?</p>
