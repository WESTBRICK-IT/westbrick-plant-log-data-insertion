========================================
<p>- LPG bullet was relieving to boot. Raised de-eth temp from 92 to 98</p>

<p>- DP on the gas to gas was 500kPa. Pumped methanol to the front end. Down to 396kPa. Maybe we run this high due to K-203 now?</p>

<p>- K-203 cyl 2 all four outboard valves gone. Dan here changing them out. Started K-201 while K-203 was down. Back up running and all good</p>

<p>- Blew down amine reflux flow transmitter</p>

<p>- Orion hauled two loads of Tangle Creek</p>
