<p>Gas Drive here until 20:00hrs.</p>

<p>Ryan Blair had to go and orientate a driver from NorthWest Tank Lines at Brazeau North</p>

<p>Restored fire eyes at Pem North when Gas Drive were finished</p>

<p>Called Laverne with Vermillion to inform us prior to lighting their flare, so we could go and man Braz with fire-eyes on by-pass</p>

<p>Vermillion (Randy Waldner) called and said they were ready to light their flare, Ryan Blair went to man Braz North with the Fire-eyes on by-pass</p>

<p>Lost K-103 on detonation one time</p>

<p>Fire eyes don&#39;t seem to be picking up anything, Ryan B turned fire-eyes bypass off and returned to Pem North</p>

<p>Pembina pipe BS&amp;W ringing in on the bubble</p>
