========================================
<p>Measurement Inc out today to prove meters around the plant</p>

<p>Kevin T. changed lights at process</p>

<p>Core Labs out today for weekly samples</p>

<p>Opened up louvers on K-201 and K-202</p>

<p>Increased De-but cooler fan speed to 100%</p>

<p>Plowed snow at K-203 and at the water well</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>V-101 Level control dump valve wasn&#39;t dumping fast enough today. Seemed like there&#39;s too much liquid for the vessel to handle. High level in the sep was closing the BP control valve to MP and to K-204 while the separator dumped. K-204 was going in and out of recycle. Lost K-204 on a bad valve on Cyl #1.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Dan K. Changed K-204 Cyl #1 valves.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Kristina and Mike changed trim and plunger in the V-101 LC dump valve and checked for any plugs/restrictions. Condy dump line was frosted on the outside of the pipe. Suspect freezing was the problem as when we fired back up the vessel was dumping much better.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Back Pressure Control Valve BPY-101 [Gas through FQI-99 to MP (K-206)] was put into manual at 65% to force more gas to K-204. Talked to Daren to ensure if the vessel high levels, the Level override will close the valve. Confirmed it&#39;s low select.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Started an MOC and put in a WO to upsize the trim in the V-101 LC dump valve from 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; or 1&quot;</strong></span></p>

<p>Pumped up the glycol leg on K-204 suction scrubber. ensured there was no liquid level in the sep.</p>
