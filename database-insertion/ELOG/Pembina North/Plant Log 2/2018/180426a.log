<p>Dan did service on K-5000 while it was down</p>

<p>Shut down C3 Compressor to do valves on cylinder 4 outboard (suction and discharge)</p>

<p>Started K-201 to take some load off of K203 when C3 went down (left running at shift change)</p>

<p>Dan replaced the sheaves on both fans</p>

<p>Fans are spinning faster than normal so Dan had to repitch them</p>

<p>GGT hauled in 4 loads of Zeta Creek water</p>

<p>Shut down lean oil due to C3 being down all day</p>

<p>Lowered De-eth bottom temps to 89 degrees</p>

<p>Just got C3 started at 4:00pm</p>

<p>Mike was doing PM checks and did the valves on AG compressor (Devin with Nexsource out to help)</p>

<p>Drained lots of oil off the chiller</p>

<p>Mancal pigged into V-103</p>

<p>Kevin T removed H2S head in amine building and submitted a bypass report, signed by Raymond</p>

<p>Surface water sample report came back, Ditch #3 failed, the rest are good to go. Released #1,4,5</p>

<p>Saskatoon Boiler out to look at the Volcano heater as per B149.3 work</p>

<p>Keep an eye on holding pond #5, it accumulates quickly and is washing the road out</p>
