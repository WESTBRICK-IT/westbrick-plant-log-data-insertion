========================================
<p>De-eth reflux flow meter pinned and tops temp warming up. Gradually cut back bottoms temp from 99 to 95 causing less reflux. Tops temp cooled back down. Reflux rate and ethane spec holding steady.</p>

<p>Glycol hanging up in glycol seperator. Stroked dump valve with no luck. Breifly cycled methanol backwards through dump valve and it started dumping again.</p>

<p>Had a bit of liquids in the inlet coalescer filter. Adjusted the dump controller slightly to get it to dump, had to dial it back abit to get it to stop dumping. Should be fairly close. Will have to continue to monitor as it may stick open.</p>

<p>K-202 chemical pump suction leaking abit. Tightened up and cleaned up containment and set rates on both K-202 and 208 pumps to 3 L/day.</p>

<p>Recycled out of the boot vessel.</p>

<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump packing lubricator.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers abit on K-202. 208 and 203 to lower amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 32%. Left the makeup pump rate at 10%.</p>

<p>K-203&#39;s top louvers and internal recycle louvers are both open. Recycling warm gas. WO#31357.</p>
