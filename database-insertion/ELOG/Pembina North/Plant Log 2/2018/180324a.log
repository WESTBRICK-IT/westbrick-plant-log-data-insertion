========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Pumped out the amine drip tank</p>

<p>Raised tarps and opened louvers on the trim cooler</p>

<p>Opened up louvers on K-202</p>

<p>Added some amine from the underground tanks</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauling in Zeta water</p>

<p>Vermillion brought on approximately 15e3m3 of gas and 40m3 of condy into WPNE 5-14 line</p>

<p>Iconic (Trevor) here with a welder working on trays by the LPG building for the Key-Link project</p>

<p>Swapped gas on the splitter line to Bigoray offload line at 13:30hrs. Blocked in V-107 on the high line and blocked in the inlet and gas off at the vessel,</p>

<p>Splitter gas is going to V-3101 via 5-21 line and we are offloading to Bigoray (Split flowing 3 ways off V-101) Set PIC-107 to 60% in manual to control bigoray offload gas</p>

<p>Mark S looked for a pig in the WPNE line after he was finished swapping valves to Bigoray, no pig but lots of crap looked like cream corn in the barrel</p>

<p>Took K-208 and K-201 down</p>

<p>Backed off K-202 boot gas make up valve</p>

<p>Set MP to LP let down valve at 250 Kpa from 280 kpa so we would stop recycling and V-200 could open up</p>
