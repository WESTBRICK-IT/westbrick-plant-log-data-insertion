========================================
<p>Dan replaced the belt on &quot;A&quot; recycle pump.</p>

<p>Mike M, Greg G and Devin N did compressor PM&#39;s</p>

<p>K-203 rang in on high comp oil temp @ 1600, we swung the gas out of the the reboiler for V3101 to see if that would help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Glycol rate started bouncing around.&nbsp; Ran pump bypass in manual at 44% for a couple of hours then put back in manual.</p>

<p>Still have quite a bit of diff on our gas to gas and Chiller.&nbsp; Pumped methanol twice to try and break it, didnt seem to help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Found hot valves on &quot;A&quot; C3 comp. Lining up work so we will shut down the C3 and get a bunch of work done to minimize the Electric motor coming up and down.</p>

<p>Put in KITS for when comms were lost between NP and NB during Keylink startup</p>

<p>Ordered steamer for morning to do a few culverts</p>

<p>Redirected some water with the skidsteer to keep Obsidian Road from washing out anymore</p>

<p>GGT hauled in 4 loads of Braz and Zeta water and emptied out lube oil waste barrels</p>

<p>Shut down main H20 charge pump and left boosters running @ 3250kpa on well</p>

<p>Topped up K205 governor oil</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump lube oil</p>

<p>Dumped holding ditches</p>

<p>Ordered RO water</p>

<p>K203 compressor oil differential press. reading 100kpa, possible cause of HI temp alarm - Work ordered. WO #29296</p>

<p>Slowed down K-203 to 800 RPM due to HI Comp. oil temp</p>
