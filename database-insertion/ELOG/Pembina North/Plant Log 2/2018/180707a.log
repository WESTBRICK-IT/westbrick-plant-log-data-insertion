<p>K-204 engine oil level sight glass was full. Yesterday it was 80%. Oil level on dipstick was approx 3 inches above the full line. Blocked in the G30 oil at the tank as there was no block valve at the Kenco. Devon N came out and worked on it. Couldnt find anything in particular wrong with it.</p>
