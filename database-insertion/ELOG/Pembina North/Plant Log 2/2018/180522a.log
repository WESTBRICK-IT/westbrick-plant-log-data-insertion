========================================
<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 compressor on hi cyl 1 differential temp. c3 went down after. Darren put in a timer for this alarm and compressor was good.</p>

<p>Shut down K-205 for sheave replacment and replace cyl 2 bad valves. Swapped K-204 to sales mode during the outage.</p>

<p>Later lost K-206 on low jacket water pressure while swinging K-204/205.</p>

<p>During the flow swings and C3 outage lost glycol levels due to poor returns and started to freeze off the front end. Added a few cycles of methanol and differential came back down.</p>

<p>Lost K-203 on mystery alarm. Sat there and watched it for awhile and the RPM randomly would drop off and compressor would go down on under spreed. Dan looked at.</p>

<p>Rob and Jason hauled in Zeta and Braz water.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 this afternoon. Restarted.</p>

<p>Orion hauled Tangle Creek oil.</p>

<p>Worked on septic tank. Pump not working.</p>

<p>Icom scoped out air conditioning for the MCC.</p>

<p>Corelabs out for weekly samples.</p>

<p>Morgan and Shayla continued painting at the water plant and washed the gator.</p>

<p>C3 and K-103 are down at braz and can be fired up once the temp cools down.</p>
