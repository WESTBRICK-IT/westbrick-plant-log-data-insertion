========================================
<p>GGT delivered methanol.</p>

<p>GGT hauled Zeta water.</p>

<p>Superior delivered propane.</p>

<p>Tarpon pulling cable in compression for new fire eyes and lighting.</p>

<p>HVO hauled Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Orion hauled Tangle Creek oil.</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on mystery alarm. After it was down watched the engine JW temp ring in. Fired back up and slowed down to 650 RPM.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204.</p>

<p>LOTO water plant charge pump and P-4750 amine charge pump so Tyson could to PM&#39;s. Pumps are good to run.</p>

<p>Cut back lean oil flow rate.</p>

<p>Increased LP to boot makup slightly on K-202 as it was ringing in on low suction pressure.</p>

<p>Went to Zeta Creek to help Chris with methanol issues.</p>

========================================
<p>Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Tried to pump out the Amine drip tank at 40 %, couldn&#39;t get the Wilden pump to pump. W.O. # 30427, finally got the pump to pump and pumped out the drip tank. Amine underground tank rang in on high level, so if you need to add Amine, please pump from underground tank</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol flash tank from 1 bolt to 3 bolts</p>

<p>Lowered the Amine regen tops temperature from 34 down to 33</p>

<p>Sped up K-204 and K-205, lost K-203 while speeding up these compressors</p>

<p>Increased the Lean oil flow rate to 140 M3/Day</p>

<p>Both re-cycle pumps are in the Production tank</p>

<p>Amine skim tank rang in high level, only showing 6 bolts</p>

<p>Flare stack rang in on flame failure, all good</p>
