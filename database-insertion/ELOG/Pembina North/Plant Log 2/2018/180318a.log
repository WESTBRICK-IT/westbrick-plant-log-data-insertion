========================================
<p>Increased water makeup pump from 14% to 16%.</p>

<p>Blew down V-101 level transmitter twice.</p>

<p>Started up K-201 and K-208 due to extra gas flow from Bigoray.</p>

<p>Howard Quiring and Mike Koebernick swung inlets outside plant. V-107 is now taking splitter and Bigoray gas is now coming down 5-21 line into V-3101.</p>

<p>Increased back pressure on V-101 from 1050 KPA to 1150 KPA.</p>

<p>Increased reboiler temp valve from 43 to 45 due to increased gas flow to maintain tops temp.</p>

<p>Glycol rate has been increased from 7.5 roots to 8 roots due to increased gas flow.</p>

<p>Increased the MP to LP letdown valve from 230 KPA to 280 KPA.</p>

<p>Sped up K-205 from 800 RPM to 900 RPM to keep suction pressure down.</p>

<p>Increased LP to Boot makeup on K-208 due to boot scrubber having a hard time dumping. May have to increase it again.</p>

<p>Jason with GGT hauled in two loads of Zeta water.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in one load of Tangle Creek oil.</p>
