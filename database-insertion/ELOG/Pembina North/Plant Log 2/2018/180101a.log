<p>&nbsp;V-101 giving false level indications again, Justin blew down the level transmitter</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Dump to flare stuck open on the inlet coalescer</p>

<p>Vermillion (Tyrell) was seeing high pressure on his well close to the plant coming into V-101</p>

<p>Vermillion (Martin) called and said he was bringing on another 100 dec of gas on the WPNE line</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-202</p>

<p>Adjusted tarps on the trim cooler</p>

<p>Battery flare ringing in every once awhile, can&#39;t see nothing opening and flare stack not showing anything</p>
