========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Called Waste Management, should be out tomorrow to change out bins, Jason plowed snow around the bin today</p>

<p>Justin E locked out the water plant for Advantage &amp; Keybray to install new pulsation bottle and weld supports. Jayson N did a lockout audit on Justin&#39;s water plant lockout</p>

<p>Keabray took the pulsation dampner spool piece to town this morning as the welded flange was slightly off center. Had it re welded, X-rayed and pressure tested before they brought it back out this afternoon.</p>

<p>Dane out in the plant doing some P &amp; ID work</p>

<p>Keyera (Kenny) pigged 14-3 line. Lots of liquids, high level shutdown on TR-101 would not re-set. Finally re-set after tripping the low level shutdown ??</p>

<p>V-101 high levelled while we were having issues with TR-101, and also lost the C3 compressor</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) sucking out containments around the plant</p>
