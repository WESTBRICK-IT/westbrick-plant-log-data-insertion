========================================
<p>-HVO delivered 1 load of&nbsp;Baccaleau emulsion</p>

<p>-Swapped the hot oil pump to the east because the west was leaking oil from the tubing line. Work ordered the line.</p>

<p>-Weekend checks.</p>

<p>-Kyle worked on cleaning up the back boot room.</p>

<p>-Cut 4 degree out of the amine reboiler. Thinking the east hot oil pump moves more&nbsp;oil.</p>
