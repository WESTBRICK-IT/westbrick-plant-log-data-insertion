========================================
<p>&nbsp;1 load of Baccaleu hauled in by HVO</p>

<p>Methanolled inlet due to high chiller diff (250kpa) and high chiller temps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increased glycol flow rate to keep the chiller from freezing up.&nbsp; Put control back into auto and put rate to 6 roots from 5.&nbsp; Seemed to help.</p>

<p>Added glycol from drum to accumulator.</p>

<p>Put recycle in truck offload.</p>
