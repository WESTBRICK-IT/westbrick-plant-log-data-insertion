<p>Blew down chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Sampled and pumped out tank farm berm.</p>

<p>Hi Flow out to prove our Keylink meter.</p>

<p>Cut back lean oil flow rate from 140 m3 to 100m3 due to slowly loosing chiller temps and de eth tops satarting to warm up.</p>

<p>Fired up K-201 and slowed down K-203 to help lower inlet gas temp. Ran it by Nagy first.</p>

<p>Dropped de eth bottoms from 97 degrees to 94 degrees.</p>

<p>Corelabs out doing weekly samples.</p>

<p>Devin installed a candy cane on K-204 engine oil Kenco to see if that will solve the issue with not adding.</p>

<p>Orion trucked in 1 load of Tangle Creek.</p>

<p>Called cooler cleaners to come out and get K-202 and K-102 finished. They will be out on Thursday AM.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-205 and K-202 due to engine oil temps.</p>

<p>Lost the Acid Gas compressor 2x, not sure on what.&nbsp; Checked oil levels, Breakers, and VFD&#39;s found nothing.</p>

<p>Recycling out of production tank both pumps.</p>

<p>Monitored K-104 engine oil level slowly coming up in sight glass</p>

<p>Added oil to the LPG pumps.</p>

<p>Shut down K-201 as it was not needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lost K-203 (nothing flagged on panel) when I shut down K-201, went to depressure and found suction valve actuator detached so I was unable to close valve.&nbsp; found 3 of 4 bolts that hold on actuator, installed and tightened.&nbsp; Works better now.</p>

<p>Restared K-203&nbsp; and loaded.</p>

<p>Sped up K-202.</p>

<p>Increased lean oil rate from 100 to 140m3/d, increased De Eth bottom temps.</p>
