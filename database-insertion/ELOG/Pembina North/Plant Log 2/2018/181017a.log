========================================
<p>Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter, and blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor K-5000 went down on Lube oil level, cold inside the building, topped up the Kenco, and warmed up the building, Devin replumbed the Kenco bypassing the meter</p>

<p>ERP exercise, 17 people in attendance, exercise went well with a good debriefing after the exercise</p>

<p>Shut down K-202 and put K-208 online. Pulled the witches hats on 2nd stage discharge to 3rd stage suction, also pulled 3rd stage discharge to 4th stage suction, both witches hats were clean. No change</p>

<p>Devin adjusted louvers on K-202</p>

<p>Lost K-208 a couple of times on low jacket water pressure</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on high jacket water temperature, currently slowed down</p>

<p>K-204 ringing in on high discharge temp cylinder 1, 2, 3 4, directed more gas from V-101 to K-204</p>

<p>HVO ( Shane) hauled in two loads of Baccalieu</p>

<p>HVO (Ivan) hauled in a load of Baccalieu</p>

<p>RPM (Al) delivered 850 litres of glycol, orientated</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor 5100 cooler VFD surging and ringing in and out on vibration. Kevin Toone is coming out to have a look</p>

<p>Devin N adjusted K-202 louvers as they were not controlling properly.</p>

<p>K-208 4th stg suction scrubber dump sticks open and sticks closed. The float in the float column seems to be hanging up. Devin N is aware and will have a better look at it tomorrow. Had to crack the scrubber dump controller bypass to keep it running.</p>
