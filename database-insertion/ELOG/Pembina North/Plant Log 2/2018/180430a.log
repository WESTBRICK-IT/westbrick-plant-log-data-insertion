========================================
<p>Shut down lean oil today because Dan and Apecs were out to change out a C3 condenser fan.</p>

<p>Left one fan run while they changed out the other and kept &quot;A&quot; C3 running.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worked fairly well.</p>

<p>Apecs serviced the Amine cooler fans.</p>

<p>Talked to Kelly about hauling out our used oil, he said for me to hold off and he was going to make some phone calls.&nbsp;&nbsp; Might want to talk to him about it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Ordered some c3 for here and Braz.</p>

<p>Brought the lean oil back on and put the de eth bottom temps to 100.</p>

<p>Switched to the biggger LPG pumps, and called Rimbey to take some more.</p>

<p>Strata out and proved the truck offload meter.</p>

<p>Took apart the fuel gas purge on K-203 and found one of the new nipples cracked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Left unit down and locked out until tomorrow.</p>

<p>Put new pink slips in the trucks, night shifts is on the desk.</p>
