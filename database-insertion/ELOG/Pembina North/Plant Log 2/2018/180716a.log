========================================
<p>Topped up LPG pumps.</p>

<p>Alex with Core Labs out to do weekly samples.</p>

<p>Al with HVO haulled out Baccalieu 6-12-48-12W5M oil.</p>

<p>Hi-Flow out to prove mass flow meter at battery truck offload.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT out to assist with mass flow meter proving at battery truck offload.&amp; hauled Zeta water</p>

<p>Changed filters in H2O building/ switched filter pots.</p>

<p>Started up K-201 and slowed down K-203, they are both running at 750RPM</p>

<p>C3 Suction control was put in MANUAL after K-201 started due to fluctuating suction (nightshift will have to put to AUTO if they shut down K-201)</p>

<p>Cut 7 deg out of the deeth bottom from 97 down to 90, will need increase tonight</p>

<p>Slowed K-205 Down because of high engine oil and jacket water temp, kept climbing throughout the day, it is now doing 725RPM</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204 to 760RPM from 870.</p>

<p>Orion (Renni) Haulled in 1 load of tangle creek.</p>

<p>Kyle did LPG samples for Kristina.</p>

<p>High BS&amp;W rang in, called Pembina to reset their pump.Still high BS&amp;W nightshift monitor</p>

<p>Nightshift to speed up comps, shut down K201, C3 suction/hot gas bypass put back on auto, raise lean oil rate back up &amp; increase deeth bottom temp</p>

<p>Switched Recycle Pump B into the Production tank.</p>
