<p>Dan K replaced cylinder #1 inboard and outboard discharge valves. Inboard had a hole.</p>

<p>Mike M replaced the level transmitter on K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Verified level in K-204 suction scrubber but it would not dump. No luck with baker pump and methanol. Had to pump in PAO-1001 chemical and let it sit for an hour. Slowly started to dump. All good now.</p>

<p>Blew down V-101 level transmitter and sight glass.</p>

<p>Hauled 5 barrels of compressor oil over to K-206 for its upcoming service.</p>

<p>Called ok tire for a status on the Braz North shift truck. They are waiting on parts and should be in thursday/friday. Truck should be ready the following week.</p>

<p>Hvo delivered three loads from baccalieu.</p>

<p>GGT hauled in two loads of Zeta Creek water.</p>

<p>Water plant level climbed up today while we were outside. Kicked on the big charge pump to get the level down and monitored for sound and vibration. All good.</p>

<p>Took a water cut on the treater oil. Spun 0.4%. Due to Cynthia oil Taggart wants to increase PAO-1001 rate to approx 28L/day. Will turn it up tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fired up K-204. Pinched in flow to Bigoray to approx 55m3. Set V-101 gas off to K-206 to 1250 kpa. Everything seems to be currently flowing where it was before.</p>

<p>WPNE line was pigged and batched.</p>
