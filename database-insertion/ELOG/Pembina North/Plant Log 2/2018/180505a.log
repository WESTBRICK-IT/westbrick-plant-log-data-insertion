========================================
<p>Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Added a little glycol from the reclamation barrel</p>

<p>Called Nelson Bros. for 6m3 of process water for Sunday morning</p>

<p>Called Rimbey Keylink to increase our flow and suck down our level (we&#39;re over 400m3)</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in Zeta Creek and Braz water</p>

<p>Cleaned shift truck and floated the yard</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks</p>

<p>Both re-cycle pumps are in the production tank</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">Water plant main disposal pump is turned off (hammering) both booster pumps are on in hand mode. Keep an eye on the level</span></p>

<p>Blaine when I closed the E-Log this morning I don&#39;t think you had submitted it. So you will probably have to re-submit Friday nights log</p>

<p>Jayson discarded the fan sheaves from the res gas cooler</p>

<p>Added oil to the LPG lubricators</p>

<p>Jayson fixed the leaking Wilden pump at the water plant</p>

<p>The C3 is ringing in on high motor load. The hot gas bypass is closed, took some load off of the lean oil. Flow rate was 180m3/day now at 120m3/day. You can speed up the lean oil once the outside ambient temperatures drop off</p>

<p>Glycol flow rate at Braz started bouncing around at 17:20hrs.</p>
