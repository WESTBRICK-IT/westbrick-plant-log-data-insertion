========================================
<p>1 load of Baccalieu emulsion hauled in by HVO.</p>

<p>Oredered RO water should arrive today.</p>

<p>Added C3 to the surge tank, added 9 bolts.&nbsp; Looks like both tanks are empty.</p>

<p>Increased reboiler trim from 39 to 41 to get the top temps back up.</p>

<p>Swept the frost off the cooler screens a few times through out the night, pulled the filter screen down on the reboiler to prevent that pluggin off.</p>
