========================================
<p>Lost amine booster pump pressure. Kept starting and stopping.&nbsp; Switched to opposite pump in hand.&nbsp; Switched back to auto once LEL head was calibrated.&nbsp; See next comment.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 5X on emergency S/D.&nbsp; Called out Mike M.&nbsp; Found LEL head in amine skid was out of calibration and had no alarm tied into it.&nbsp; Calibrated LEL head, and set up to alarm on wonderware.</p>
