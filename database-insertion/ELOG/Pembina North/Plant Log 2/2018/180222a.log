========================================
<p>Opened up control valve (V-107 page) through Bigoray Offload Meter because it wasn&#39;t reading a diff this morning.</p>

<p>K-206 down for an oil change and compression test today. Apecs out to do it. Started up K-201 and swapped K-203 to MP in the mean time. After the service, put it all back to normal and shut down K-201</p>

<p>Mike M. changed out K-206 suction controller during the service today. Compressor is working in auto now. He also worked on the K-206 Panel.</p>

<p>Lost C3 on 2nd stage res gas low pressure while swapping the other comps today. Raised Back pressure on the plant to compensate but it was to no avail. Back to normal at shift change.</p>

<p>Lifted tarps on the amine cooler today</p>

<p>Opened up louvers on K-202, sped up de-bute cooler fan</p>

<p>Keylink workers out to work on the tower today. Orientated 3 of them</p>

<p>GGT hauled in 2 loads of Cynthia Oil</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil</p>

<p>Orion hauled in one load of Tangle Creek oil</p>

<p>Lowered pressure in water flash tank to get the flare KO to pump to it, then raised it once fluid was moving. Flare KO is pumping out at shift change</p>

<p>Turned on the booster pumps at the water plant to get rid of some of the level. Keeps going down on sequence fail cause the Charge pump wants to start up too. It&#39;s still turned off.</p>

<p>Obsidian stopped by to question hi line pressure on WPNA. It had come down since he last saw it so decided to leave it untill tomorrow.</p>

<p>Brought a bbl of 220 oil down to K-203 / K-204</p>

<p>Associated sanding truck did a loop by the bullet and the front driveway today. Told him to stop by Zeta and Braz as well</p>
