========================================
<p>HVO offloaded some Baccalieu emulsion</p>

<p>Methanoled inlet due to increased diff on the chiller. It was 200kpa nad dropped to 177.</p>

<p>noticed the tape on the amine h2s sensor was getting low.&nbsp; Please monitor.</p>

========================================
<p>Devin N calibrated and cleaned process and sales analysers.</p>

<p>Changed tape on process analyser.</p>

<p>Kevin T tested UPS and recorded cathodic readings.</p>

<p>Darren worked on Comms issues with the H20 plant.</p>

<p>Slowed the lean oil rate down from 140 to 100 m/day.</p>

<p>Lowered the de-eth bottoms temp down to 93 from 100 degrees due to the de-eth tops temp warming up after cutting the lean oil.</p>

<p>Started K-201 to lower amine contactor inlet temp. Dropped 4 degrees.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-203 and K-201 to 730 RPM to prevent res gas from recycling too much.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-202 due to engine oil temp.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in three loads of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Cleaned basket strainer on Recycle Pump B.</p>

========================================
<p>2 loads of Tangle creek hauled in by Orion</p>

<p>Methanolled inlet due to high diff on the chiller.</p>

<p>Increased flow rate on lean oil back to 140m3/d&nbsp; increased De-Eth bottoms temp up to 97 degrees.</p>

<p>added oil to LPG pump</p>

<p>Sped up K-202, left the others slowed down to get a head start for tomorrow.</p>
