========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Added oil to the acid gas compressor</p>

<p>HVO (Len) hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil from 1-19-49-11 W5m, had trouble offloading, usually offloads at 40 psi. took him 80 psi. to pump off</p>

<p>Called Mike M and informed him of our issues at the mass meter (making lots of noise). Kristina C called back and said she would come out Sunday morning if we were still having issues</p>

<p>Work ordered the truck offload mass meter, also better heat tracing required for the basket strainer, W.O. # 28600</p>

<p>Pulled and cleaned the basket strainer for the mass meter, it was plugged pretty bad</p>

<p>Shovelled snow</p>

<p>De-eth overheads cooler fan speed at 0 %</p>

<p>Iconic out working on Keylink project.</p>

<p>Hydro Vac out trenching for cables for Keylink.</p>

<p>V-101 level bouncing around.&nbsp; Blew down sightglass and level column.&nbsp; All Good.</p>

<p>Recycle swung to production tank from overflow.</p>

<p>Added pressure gauges to the inlet, middle and discharge of the mass flow meter.&nbsp; Waiting for truck to offload so we can trouble shoot.&nbsp; Tried to pump recycle through, but seemed like it was dead heading.</p>

<p>Weekend and Monthly checks.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>HVO (Al) hauled in two loads of Baccalieu oil from 3-16-47-11 W5m and 6-12-48-12 W5m. Pressure at the truck offload line was 25 kpa, 15 kpa just before the meter, and 60 kpa after the meter. The driver also mentioned that his offload rates are down, so believe we still have a restriction somewhere.</p>

<p>Getting a false level indication on V-101, getting gas through the dump valve. Blew down the level column, all good now</p>
