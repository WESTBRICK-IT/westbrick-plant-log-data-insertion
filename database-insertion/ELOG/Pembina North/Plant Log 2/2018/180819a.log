========================================
<p>Recieved 2 loads of Baccalieu oil from HVO.</p>

<p>Recieved the 14-03 pig.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-205 due to temps.</p>

<p>K-202 4th stg suct scrubber dump valve was opening 100% and wouldnt close until the scrubber was empty causing gas to go to the boot. Adjusted to proportional band (from 2 to 1) on the controller. Valve opens up slowly and closes slowly nown and is controlling much better. No more ice on the dump line and boot is no longer relieving to flare.</p>

<p>Lowered the LP to Boot makeup valve on K-202.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Lowered the lean oil rate from 140 to 100 m3/day to take load off of the c3 compressor.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in a load of Tangle Creek emulsion.</p>

<p>Drug the front parking area to fill some ruts.</p>
