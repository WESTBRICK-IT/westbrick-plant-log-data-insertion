========================================
<p>- tightened amine charge pump packing</p>

<p>- skimmed charcoal filter. little oil</p>

<p>- amine make up water from 12 to 5. Wanted to keep water moving through the line but not use all the water and suck up air.</p>

<p>- Kevin T out to swap C3 breakers</p>

<p>- DP across chiller was 220kPa. Decided to do a warm up before starting C3A last night. Got it back down to 100kPa</p>

<p>- C3 A down twice due to tremendous amounts of lube oil in the suction scrubber. <strong>Propane de-oiler tank was full and could not drain into after warm up. Need GGT to suck out.</strong></p>

<p>- Suction valve on C3 is 45% manual. Wanted to run C3 long enough for the lube oil to stay stuck to the sides of the chiller.</p>

<p>- Added C3</p>

<p>- Blew down C3 level transmitter. Was full of lube oil. Pumped up the wet leg with glycol.</p>

<p>- <strong>Do not use C3 scrubber pump to flare. Leaks badly. Work ordered</strong></p>

<p>- Blew down V-101 level transmitter.</p>

<p>Orion delivered 2 loads of Tangle Creek Oil</p>

<p>HVO delivered one load of Baccalieu Oil</p>

<p>Bigoray swug EGGS to us today by ESD&#39;ing 5-21, opened up blue manual valve on top of the highline at 3008 and 3007 meters and swung EGGS to V-107. Put FY-3007 in auto at 1400 Kpa. Shut manual valve at 3007 meter and opened up inlet and outlet valves on V-107.</p>

<p>Started up K-201</p>

<p>Rob delivered 4 loads of water from Zeta and 2 loads of water from Braz and sucked out the chiller de-oiler blowdown tank.</p>

<p>Jason did some snow plowing</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivered 6m3 of TW to the RO water Tank</p>

<p>Core labs wanted to come out for monthly samples, Kristina called them off as our flows are all swung around today.</p>

<p>Baker Hughes ou to deliver a bbl of scale inhibbitor.</p>

<p>6-23 riser on Dominion line ESD&#39;d this morning, called feild ops to notify and they opened it back up</p>

<p>Turned on the main charge pump at the water plant today and did some troubleshooting on the vibration issues with Dan and Raymond this afternoon. Brought the pressure down on the Suc and Dis de-surger bladders and most of the racket disappeared. Noticed that the rest of the vibration and clanging disappeared when we opened the suction valve to the set of filters that is not in service. Possible its acting as a suction bladder itself. Will look into it some more with Dan tomorrow. For now the main charge pump is running and the suction valve to the spare filters is open.</p>

<p>Put in WO for another vibration switch at the suction end of the water plant pumps</p>

<p>Put in a WO to get the pressure transmitters on the water plant system verified / callibrated</p>
