========================================
<p>- Opened up V-104</p>

<p>- C3 compressor surging this morning. Slowed down K-203, put back into auto at 2150kPa, to close the C3 let down valve, and increased propane suction pressure from 30kPa to 35kPa. Seemed to help</p>

<p>- Moved a bunch of parts for Dan to K-203 with the skid steer</p>

<p>- Orion hauled in one load of Tangle Creek</p>

<p>- GGT hauled in multiple loads of Braz water</p>

<p>- R.O water delivered</p>

<p>- Kevin finished wiring in blackline base</p>

<p>- Increased dump span on V-101 from 32% to 28%. It looked to be JT across the valve.</p>

<p>- Opened WPNA to the pig barrel and then to PNA line to let the pressure go down. WPNA line is froze off between the inlet header building and V-200</p>

<p>- Justin worked on new berm realse documentation as per Bob. Will be out thursday to verify.</p>

<p>- Mark batched the splitter</p>
