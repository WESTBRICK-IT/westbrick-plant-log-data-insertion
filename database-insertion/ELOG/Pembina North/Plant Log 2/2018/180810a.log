<p>Lost K-205 on high JW temp.&nbsp; X2.</p>

<p>Lost K-203 on eng failure.&nbsp; X2.</p>

<p>Sped up K-206, 205 and 204 once ambiet temps cooled down.</p>

<p>Lost alot of propane.&nbsp; Pressure on surge tank up over 1600.&nbsp; Tried to add with pump.&nbsp; Pump not turning on (Get electrician to inspect tomorrow).&nbsp; Found both valves for adding propane open.&nbsp; Possibly fed back to storage tank.&nbsp; Tank level at 50%.</p>

<p>Increased amine make-up water to 12 from 6.</p>

<p>Glycol bouncing around most the night.&nbsp; Blew down float column on glycol flash tank and sight glass.&nbsp; Glycol really foamy at begginging of the night in both the flash tank and glycol sep.&nbsp; By 2 am seems to have worked itselt out.</p>

========================================
<p>-Lost k203 compressor went down while trying to speed it up in the morining, it backfired then when down. Restarted</p>

<p>-Superior propane delivered c3</p>

<p>-Got the c3 fill up to work, had to use channal lock plyers on the shaft to break it free.</p>

<p>-Added c3 to the surge tank</p>

<p>-Having issues with glycol returns again, had to add a little from the overhead tank</p>

<p>-All compression is slowed down because of the heat.</p>

<p>-The de-eth overheads condensor bypass valve is back in manual and opened up to 55% to help take load off&nbsp; ac3</p>

<p>-Maxxam out to take lpg and oil samples.</p>

<p>-C3 compressor down once on level suction scrubber level</p>

<p>-</p>
