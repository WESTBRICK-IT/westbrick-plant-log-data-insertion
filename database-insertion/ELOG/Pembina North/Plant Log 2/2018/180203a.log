========================================
<p>- Hvo hauled in one load</p>

<p>- Orion hauled in one load</p>

<p>- Manually dumped V-104</p>

<p>- Amine make up water (black hose) Froze. Called Kevin T out, thought it was due to heat tracing but was not the issue. Had to get heat tracing pulled off. Took apart the black hose and thawed out for a couple hours. Everything back together. Hose is not secured on pipe. Will order hose clamps and install.</p>

<p>- Snow snow and more snow. Tried to plow through the horrendous grader drift that is now in front of the control room and around the plant site. Skid steer had a hydralic leak. Will look at tomorrow and try and fix. Back gate is also stuck open due to the grader plowing snow up to the gate. &nbsp;</p>

<p>- Dayton took day shift truck as braz north shift truck is still in town.</p>
