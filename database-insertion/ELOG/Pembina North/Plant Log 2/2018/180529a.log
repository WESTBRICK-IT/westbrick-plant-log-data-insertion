<p>Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>GGT (Jason) hauled in a load of water from Zeta Creek</p>

<p>Orion (Trevor) hauled in a load of Tangle Creek oil from 13-16-49-11W5m</p>

<p>Flaring a little off of the boot, adjusted 1st stage make-up on K-202</p>

<p>Manually dumped De-eth overhead scrubber</p>

<p>Added oil to K-203 governor</p>

<p>Dumped K-201 scrubber</p>

<p>Sped up compression and back in auto, except K-204</p>

<p>Re-cycle pumps are in the Production and Overflow tanks</p>

<p>De-eth and De-but towers high levelling, found the lean oil flow rate at 0 %. Blew down the level column, and pumped up the glycol leg 3X. Still not sure about the accumulator level. Brought it back online after 05:00am flow rate currently at 150 M3/Day</p>
