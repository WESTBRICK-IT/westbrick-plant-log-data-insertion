========================================
<p>Weekend and Monthly checks completed.</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters.</p>

<p>GGT (Jason) hauled in Zeta and Braz water.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in Tangle Creek.</p>

<p>Drained a lot of lube oils off bottom of the chiller.</p>

<p>HP cold seperator ringing in on &#39;high pressure&#39;, when actually its high level.&nbsp; Figured we don&#39;t have enough HP compression to get glycol seperator down in pressure.&nbsp; Not enough DP between the Cold Sep and the Glycol Sep.&nbsp; Slowed down K-205 to 610 RPM and increased recycle to 3600 KPA from 3200 KPA to help maintain more pressure on the plant.&nbsp; Also added a shot of methanol to E-3101.&nbsp; Seems good now.</p>

<p>HP cold seperator dump is pinned at 50% in auto, cant go higher than that.&nbsp; Need Daren to increase to at least 60-70%.</p>

<p>Lowered cooler discharge temps on K-204, K-201 and 4th stage on K-202 to help lower temp on contactor and reduce load on chiller.</p>

<p>Worked on Hazard ID and worksite inspections.</p>

<p>Increased fuel gas pressure for water flash tank.&nbsp; Increased big joe to pressure up to 380 KPA, was set around 200 KPA.&nbsp; Only open fuel gas when you need it.&nbsp; Otherwise please leave shut.</p>

<p>Flare number still bouncing around.&nbsp; Walked out to the base of the flare stack and could here the flare gas bubbling through liquid at the base of stack at the 45.&nbsp; Called and notified Raymond and lined up GGT for tomorrow to help drain the liquid.</p>

<p>Cathodic Solutions out for Cathodic protection survey throughout the plant.</p>
