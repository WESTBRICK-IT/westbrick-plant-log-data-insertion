========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Little oil.</p>

<p>Blew down cyclone seperator sightglass, level wasn&#39;t dumping.&nbsp; Better now.</p>

<p>K-205 oil filter dripping oil.&nbsp; Tightened nuts.&nbsp; Seems better now.</p>

<p>Shut down K-201.</p>

========================================
<p>- Mike Calibrated AG comp LEL head</p>

<p>- Raised glycol level in the glycol sep</p>

<p>- Slowed down K-205 and closed the recycle line</p>

<p>- Blew down chiller de-oiler and level transmitter lots of lube oils</p>

<p>- Blew down V-101 level transmitter</p>

<p>- Opened louvres on K-203</p>

<p>- Turn C3 two speed fan on to fast</p>

<p>- Found glycol leak on K-204, Tightened</p>

<p>- Raised de-eth temp to 98 from 94 to help with light ends in de-but</p>

<p>- DP across the Chiller was 350kPa. Pumped methanol to the front end. Did not want to shut C3 down due to motor issues</p>

<p>- Orion hauled in one load of oil</p>

<p>- GGT hauled 2 loads of zeta water</p>

<p>- Keylink out comissioning LACT unit</p>

<p>Blew down inlet coalescer.</p>

<p>Blew down front and back water sight glass on TR-101.</p>

<p>Glycol was hanging up in glycol sep. Stroked valve a bunch and pumped methanol back through a few times. Was then finally able to get it to control. Flash tank level is holding at 3 bolts, however glycol accumulator was having a hard time maintaining level.</p>

<p>Glycol filter DP guage was jumping. Changed glycol filters and level spiked up and is maintaining 60-70%. Filters very dirty.</p>

<p>Pumped methanol to front end 3x to try and get the chiller differential pressure to drop. DP slowly dropped 30 KPA through the night but still hanging around 220 KPA. May need a warm up.</p>

<p>Pinched the trim cooler louvers abit.</p>

<p>Pinched in K-203 and K-202 louvers to maintain contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Increased lean oil flow rate from 120 m/day to 180 m/day.</p>

<p>Pumping down Keylink line steadily throughout the night.</p>

<p>Topped up lubricators on LPG pumps.</p>

<p>Slowed down de-bute fans abit.</p>

<p>Recycled out of the truck offload line all night. Swung both pumps into the production tank around 03:30 am.</p>

<p>Increased de-eth bottoms temp from 98 to 101 degrees as the de-bute level was swinging abit.</p>
