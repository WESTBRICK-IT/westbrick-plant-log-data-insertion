========================================
<p>Glycol was bouncing around, pumped some methanol to get returns.</p>

<p>Lean oil pump was gas locked, got it going then shut it down due&nbsp;to unable to Chill.</p>

<p>Swapped over to &quot;B&quot; C3 compressor as A started pressuring up. &nbsp;B ran fine for a couple of hours then started pressuring up to about 100 kpa and chiller temp rose to -22. &nbsp;Shut down and blew non condensables off the to of the condenser. &nbsp;Brought unit back on and has been running at -32 for over 2 hour</p>

<p>Put in W.O. to tie in the valve off the condenser into flare. &nbsp;W.O.-26985</p>

<p>De Eth- Reflux bouncing around again.</p>

<p>Vermillion gas is coming in at 0900 this morning.</p>
