========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>GGT (Jason) hauled in a load of Braz water</p>

<p>K-202 went down 2X on high discharge temp 2nd stage. Valves need to be replaced on 2nd stage discharge outboard</p>

<p>Purged and started up K-208, had a hard time getting rid of liquids, had to add glycol to K-208 and of course it had&nbsp;the wrong fitting to the overhead tank</p>

<p>The boot header seems to be pressuring up, adjusted the boot make-up on K-208 with no success, checked everything I could think of but no luck ??</p>

<p>K-208 does not seem to be pulling off of the boot header, did not find any valves closed, (not sure about the valve by K-202 1st stage scrubber). K-208&nbsp; went down 2X on high temp first stage, and low suction pressure 1st stage</p>

<p>Started up K-202 again, will try to limp it through the rest of the night</p>
