========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Lost AC3 on low res gas discharge pressure.</p>

<p>-Increased the sweet gas suction pressure(PIC 207) to 3800 from 3200 to help increase back pressure on the plant.</p>

<p>-Added a little glycol to the system from the overhead tank.</p>

<p>-Had to call Pembina control to start the oil pump, the tank rang in on high level.</p>

<p>-The water flash tank pump is still off, had to pump it out once during the night. It seemed to only pick up suction when the switch was on hand and not Auto.</p>

<p>-Cut back on the lean oil flow to 180 from 190</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;Lost &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; C3 2x on low res gas disch pressure. Due to low gas flows. Increased sales compressor recycle from 3800 KPA to 3900 KPA and increased plant back pressure controller temperarily until flows came back. Compressor disch increased to 4400 and maintained.</p>

<p>Mark S got hydrate on 5-14 Vermillion line taken care of and flowing.</p>

<p>Set plant back pressure controller back to normal.</p>

<p>Set sales compressor recycle controller at 3800 (dropped 100 KPA) due to lots of Vermillion wells being down due to previous hydrate in pipeline. So flows will probably be low from Vermillion during the night.</p>

<p>Pumped down the water flash tank. Left hand switch off.</p>

<p>GGT hauled in 40m3 of cynthia oil as they were having issues with Pembina nominations.</p>

<p>Recieved 2 loads of Baccalieu emulsion from HVO.</p>

<p>Recieved 1 load on Tangle creek emulsion from Orion.</p>

<p>Cleaned screen on Recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;.</p>

<p>V-101 Vermillion inlet was 300 kpa higher upstream of the ESD and control valve. Pressure increased approx 280 kpa from this AM. Looked over and stroked valves. No change. Notified Vermillion operations. They batched some methanol to be on the safe side. Dropped approx 80 kpa. Please monitor.</p>

<p>Mark S sent Ariant pressure truck here to load 2m3 of methanol for hydrate he was dealing with. He will get 2 more cubes sent out here for us.</p>

<p>Slowed sales compressor from 760 down to 630 RPM due to it recycling even before recycle was increased from 3500-3800 kpa.</p>

<p>Chris page delivered bulk oil.</p>

<p>Orion will be back tonight with a second load of tangle creek emulsion.</p>

<p>Filled&nbsp;out KITS report from water plant ice plug.</p>

<p>Had to equalize the production and the overflow tank this morning due to high production tank levels.</p>

<p>Mike M calibrated acid gas compressor LEL head. as it was ringing in a false high alarm.</p>
