<p>-Slowed down the lean oil to&nbsp; help take the load off the c3</p>

<p>-Had&nbsp; to add methanol to&nbsp; the de-eth overheads due to freezing&nbsp; off. Increased the small&nbsp; pump flow per day.</p>

<p>-Core Labs out to do quartly samples.</p>

<p>-Scollard pigged the wolf creek line, pig not pulled yet.</p>

<p>-Added c3 to the accumulator.</p>

<p>-Torc was here and blinded the inlet to V-104 so they could do some work on their pipe line.</p>

<p>-Changed the amine bag filter.</p>

<p>-HVO delivered 2 loads of Baccaleau oil</p>
