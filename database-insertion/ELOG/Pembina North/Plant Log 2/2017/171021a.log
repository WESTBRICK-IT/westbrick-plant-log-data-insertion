========================================
<p>&nbsp;Slowed down K-204 sales compressor to 790 RPM due to suction makeup valve recycling.</p>

<p>Glycol sep was full of glycol, no interface in sightglass. Stroked valve, pumbed methanol back through it&nbsp;and dumped manually. Level seems to be controlling now.</p>

<p>Pinched in K-201/202 louvers to increase inlet temp to contactor.</p>

<p>Shutdown water plant booster pumps after tank level got below 8ft.</p>

<p>Sales analyser tape getting low. Will probably last another day or two. Keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Plant steady.</p>

<p>&nbsp;-Had to add 1 cycle of methanol to the hp cold sep dump valve.</p>

<p>-GGT hauled in 2 loads of cynthia oil.</p>

<p>-Orion hauled in 5 loads of Tangle Creek emulsion. One of the tickets recorderd 40m3 when he only hauled in 20m3</p>

<p>-Blue River hauled in Obsidean emulsion and 1 load of Braz water.</p>

<p>-The water plant booster pumps are on and on manual. Night shift will have to shut off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lost K-203 on overspeed.&nbsp;Overspeed flag&nbsp;on the pneumatic panel wouldnt clear until it was reset on the RPM/engine hour display.</p>

<p>Swung pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;&nbsp;into the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of Baccalieu from HVO and two loads of Tangle Creek from Orion.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the inlet coalescer filter.</p>

<p>Water plant filters tripped. Changed bag filters&nbsp;and put the other filter pot online.</p>

<p>Debute and Debute reflux started to ring in on high level. Slowed down the O/H fans from 100% to 60%. Pressure climbed and was able to dump better.</p>

<p>Pinched in K-202 louvers to raise inlet temp to contactor.</p>

<p>Maunually dumped TR-101 back water.</p>
