========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter (clean)</p>

<p>Added the remainder of the propane to the C3 surge tank</p>

<p>Jarred from Bigoray called and said they were taking the plant down (salt bath) and wanted us to take the Vermillion gas from V-101. Added glycol to K-204 and warmed up the compressor, swung valves to start taking gas. FQI 3008 not reading back to the DCS, but reading flow at the meter</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauling in Braz water</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor went down 4X, and the VFD tripped twice. The compressor does not seem to unload properly. Compressor going down on 2nd stage high differential pressure, believe that maybe 3rd stage suction witches hat is plugged</p>

<p>Worked on acid gas issues all day. &nbsp;Blocked in recycle valve and de-iced, left blocked in. &nbsp;Manual valve by-passing, iced up alot. &nbsp;Work Ordered (Suspect this as the main problem for pressure issues.</p>

<p>Blocked in 3rd and 4th stage scrubber dumps trying to get a level, left blocked in.</p>
