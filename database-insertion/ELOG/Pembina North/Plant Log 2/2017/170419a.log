========================================
<p>Had a hard time getting the water flash tank to pump down</p>

<p>Added propane to the C3 surge tank (1 bolt to 6 bolts)</p>

<p>McElhanney Surveyors and Central line locators out working on the keylink project</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauling in Braz water</p>

<p>Morning meeting and Safety meeting</p>

<p>Lost the acid gas compressor numerous times on high delta pressure 2nd stage. Believe the automatic and manual re-cycle valves are passing (Automatic re-cycle is blocked in), also something funky with the Refux accumulator pressure control (PIC-4355) and the VFD suction pressure control (PIC-5000) currently running both of those controllers in manual. Mike M will order some parts for the trims on the re-cycle valves</p>

<p>Kent Fuson out for the safety meeting</p>

<p>Mike M did PM&#39;s on the tank farm</p>

<p>Mark S sent a pig on the 14-03 line, lots of liquids ( pulled 2 blue pigs and 1 green pig, all clean)</p>

<p>Lowered the pressure on the amine flash tank from 750 kpa to 720 kpa</p>

<p>Tri-Energy (Otis and Albert) working on water filters at the water plant</p>

<p>Re-cycling from the truck off-load line</p>
