========================================
<p>Shut down C3A, blew down c3 off the high point on the condensor for approx 1.5 hrs, never did get a propane vapour or visible propane. Kevin T out to check why C3B switch gear would not engage, he made adjustment to the lever that lifts the breaker into place, started C3B, at the start there was 500 kpa off the chiller &amp; accumilator, took long time for suction to lower pressure down, played with gylcol level from being down, added from reclaimation tank as well from overhead, level did return after, pressured up on the front end of the chiller, injected methenal acouple times, pressure did come down some then went back up, injected again, then started to get some cooling off the chiller, added C3 from storage, took 80 % out of south storage which is now empty. accumilater was at 6 bolts when finished adding &amp; chiller leveled out. Not much for lube oils when blew down.</p>

<p>Speed up compressors</p>

<p>Left recycle pump B down due production tank level, pembina has not pumped any today sence last night,</p>

<p>Mass Flood from storm, lots of lighting &amp; thunder, no issues with power.</p>
