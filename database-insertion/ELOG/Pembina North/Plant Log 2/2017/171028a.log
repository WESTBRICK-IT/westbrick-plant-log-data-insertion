========================================
<p>&nbsp;Orion hauled in Tango Creek oil</p>

<p>GGT-Jason hauled in braz &amp; zeta water</p>

<p>Cynthia called wanted to test flowing more to them, for us to pinch flow, did so by dropping here about 60 dec&#39;s, then after a half hr they called back had compressor problems, took gas flow back</p>

<p>Vermillion gas dropped off this morning, causing k204 to go down, left down, then later they stopped by said they were pigging into the plant soon, slugged in hard, causing to carry over into Mp header, lost K206 &amp; C3A, restarted. down approx 1 hr total upset</p>

<p>K204 could not start due to a burst disc blown near end of shift tring to get ahold of Dan to find the disc&#39;s to replace, night shift to continue</p>

<p>Changed Amine bag filter due to upset</p>

<p>Water Plant filters triped, switched to the east pot, changed west filters, ready to go</p>

<p>Weekend checks</p>
