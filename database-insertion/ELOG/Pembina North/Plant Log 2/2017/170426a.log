========================================
<p>Tri energy was out working on filter instal.</p>

<p>Penn West pigged 1-21 and PNA and Mancal pigged into V-103. High leveled V-200 and V-103. TR-101 was getting hit hard and inlet gas flows were bouncing around. Lost recycle pump &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; as a result.</p>

<p>Lost acid gas compressor also due to fluctuations in flow at the time.</p>

<p>Recieved 3 loads of 6-12 Baccalieu oil from HVO.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 at shift change due to lube oil no flow shutdown. Fired up all good.</p>

<p>Carl with MRC global was out.</p>

<p>Taggart with Baker hughes was out to fill up our scale inhibitor tank.</p>

<p>Called INET today to get the docking station for the gas monitor working today.</p>

<p>Added c3 to the accumulator.</p>

<p>Added 2 cups of antifoam to the amine regen due to possible foaming issues. Skimmed the charcoal filter, reflux accum and the flash tank.</p>

<p>V-103 high leveled today due to the Mancal pig coming in. Couldnt get it to dump until we went out to troubleshoot the issue. Stroked the dump valve a couple times and it took off.</p>
