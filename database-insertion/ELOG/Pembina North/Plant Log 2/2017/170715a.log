========================================
<p>-Lost Ac3 on overload</p>

<p>-Lost K-206 once.</p>

<p>-Fought all night with high pressures on Ac3 and no level in the chiller. We pumped up the glyco leg on the chiller level controler.</p>

<p>-Shut down Ac3 and started Bc3 to help trouble shoot to see if it was giving us the same issues. Things lined out after BC3 was restarted.</p>

<p>-Added &nbsp;c3 from the storage tanks.</p>

<p>-Sped &nbsp;up all compression</p>

========================================
<p>Lost C3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; on low suction pressure.</p>

<p>Pumped propane out of the accumulator back to storage tank as it was full and out of the site glass.</p>

<p>Pumped up the glycol leg on the chiller and blew down the low side of the level transmitter and lowered the level on the chiller from 50% to 45%. Chiller temp dropped down to -35 degrees.</p>

<p>Fired C3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; back up after lowering C3 levels in the accumulator and chiller. Stayed running, all good.</p>

<p>Tried to fire up C3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; and start the lean oil but we could not get control power on the C3 breaker. Notified Kelly.</p>

<p>Fired up K-203 to run in sync with K-206 due to high temps on K-206.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on low compressor oil pressure, Tried speeding up abit to increase oil pressure but the JW temp started to ring in and went down on high temp. Left K-206 down as K-203 was doing fine due to low gas flows.</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on low compressor oil pressure, Sped up from 730 to 800 RPM to make up for this.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 and K-202 due to high oil temps.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk hauling in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>V-101 Rang in on high. However, the level was only saying 20%. Verified the high level switch wasnt tripped. Blew down capilaries and sight glass to verify level and it is reading accurate with what the level transmitter is saying. But High level alarm is still rang in on the banner.</p>

<p>De-eth reflux accumulator level transmitter is jumping all over. Will get mike to look at it monday.</p>

<p>Cleaners were out.</p>

<p>Closed the bypass around the amine lean/rich exchanger, and it seems to be controlling well.</p>

<p>swung out of the overflow and put both pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>Weekend checks.</p>

<p>Notified Ken with Northwest that our LPG production will be lower than usual.</p>

<p>Glycol flow controller was bouncing around, put in manual for abit and it would line itself out the back in auto. May need to lower flow due to low gas flows.</p>
