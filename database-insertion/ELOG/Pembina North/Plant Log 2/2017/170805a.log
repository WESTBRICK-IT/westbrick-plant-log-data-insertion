========================================
<p>- Skimmed amine charcoal filters. Lil oil</p>

<p>- Blocked in the oil line on deoiler and let the deoiler vessel sit and warm up. opened drain and got a good pail of lube oils. Put back into service.</p>

<p>- Added propane. 0 bolts to 6 bolts. Checked periodically to make sure it was propane and not dry ethane.</p>

<p>- Lowered methanol to De-eth from Max to 120 L/Day</p>

<p>- Rob T hauling Obsidian and zeta water</p>

<p>- De-but had 19% ethane and was at 1100kPa. Raised temp on De-eth to drive more ethanes off</p>

<p>- Tightened packing on glycol pump</p>

<p>- Slowed down compression</p>

<p>- Weekend checks</p>

<p>- Glycol swinging, glycol sep has maintianed level and so had the flash tank. Made sure DP across filters was working. Blew down the level floats just cause. Conc 72% lean and 67% rich. Had to pump methanol to front end (2 cycles)</p>
