========================================
<p>- Inlet coalescer dump line froze. Got it thawed out and dumping fine.</p>

<p>- Glycol pump packing was smoking. Loosened the packing nut to let some glycol drip. All good</p>

<p>- W.O. flow controller on the glycol. Reads 0% but is passing. Have to go out and manually close the gate vale to increase pressure and flow. Turned VFD to 7 roots and put into auto for the night.</p>

<p>- Al from HVO hauling in insch oil.</p>

<p>- Recycle pump B down 2X. Restarted</p>
