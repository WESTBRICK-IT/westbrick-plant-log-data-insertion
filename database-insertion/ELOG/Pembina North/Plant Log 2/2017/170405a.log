========================================
<p>K-3301A went down on high scrubber level</p>

<p>Lean oil was down at start of shift, restarted and it kept going down. Blew down the level column and re-filled the glycol leg, the level does not seem to be reading correctly (pump running 100% and no flow rate). Have Mike M please check it out as I cannot seem to be able to log in to anything (Maximo etc.)</p>

<p>Lost glycol level, added some from the overhead tank</p>

<p>K-201 cylinder # 3 ringing in on bad valve temp alarm, getting around an 8 degree variation, please have Dan K check it out</p>

<p>Blew down level column on lean oil and sightglass. &nbsp;Pumped up glycol leg. &nbsp;Lean oil surge tank at 16%.</p>

<p>Lowered de-eth tops temp to 85 from 104 while lean oil was down. &nbsp;This also helped pressure up the stabilizer to help dump lean oil to surge tank.</p>

<p>Slowly filled up lean oil surge tank, once at a level of close to 60%, fired up lean oil pump and set for 120 m3/day.</p>

<p>Slowly increased lean oil flowrate and as I did so increased de-eth temp back to 104 degrees. &nbsp;Lean oil flowrate set at 200 m3/day.</p>

<p>GGT hauled in a load of Bigoray oil.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Insch oil.</p>

<p>Recycling out of the truck offload.</p>

<p>Volcano switched to low fire.</p>

<p>Daren reactivated alarms&nbsp;on lean oil, they were disabled a couple years ago when lean oil was shutdown.</p>

<p>Shut down K-201 to changed valves on 3rd cylider inboard. &nbsp;Fired up K-203 while K-201 was down. &nbsp;Back to normal operations.</p>

<p>Nigel work ordered overhead condesor two speed fan. &nbsp;Belts need tightening.</p>

<p>Lowered amine make-up water to 12 from 15. &nbsp;Amine surge tank level above 55%.</p>

<p>Started MOC to remove carseals 67 and 67A for K-201 suction scrubber dump.</p>

<p>Kelly informed us that the next time Rob T is out, have him suck down the pressure on the water well casing. &nbsp;If he is hauling in water, shut the pumps off before he offloads to keep pressure on the casing so he can bleed it off.</p>

========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter (clean)</p>

<p>Raised the flow rate on the Lean oil to 250 M3/day</p>

<p>Added glycol to K-206 overhead</p>

<p>HVO (Brett) hauled in two loads of Baccalieu oil from 15-10, and 4-28</p>

<p>HVO (Shane) hauled in two loads of Baccalieu oil from 16-13</p>

<p>Dallas did lots of orientations for Northwest drivers at Braz</p>
