<p>Started up K-206 and shutdown K-203.</p>

<p>Shutdown K-204 and swung V-103 gas back into the MP header.</p>

<p>Sped up K-206 and K-201.</p>

<p>Skimed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Called Pembina due to production tank level getting high. They had a power failure so pumps wont be kicking on until the AM if they get the issue resolved. Was recycling out of both tanks, put both pumps back into production tank.</p>

<p>Glycol accumulator level slowly trended down through the night, monitoring, leveled out at 45-55% and was holding. Started to drop abit lower around 05:00AM. Put recycle valve in manual at 48% and dropped the flow down to 9m3 from 12m3 due to possibly hanging up in exchanger? Level now trending up slowly.</p>
