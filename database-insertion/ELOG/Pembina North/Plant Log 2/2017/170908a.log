========================================
<p>Jamie with HVO brought 2 loads of Baccalieu oil</p>

<p>Jason with GGT brought a load of Obsidian water and a load Braz water</p>

<p>Marty and Glen with GGT brought together 4 loads of Cynthia oil to the battery</p>

<p>Tri energy out today to tie in the rest of the piping at the water plant (for the filters). Cant tie in the last spool piece (filter PSV relief to the prime tank) because we will need a truck to empty the tank completely as the new spool will be replacing the current isolation valve (Clip-gate)</p>

<p>Water Plant is back online but filters are still LOTO&#39;d</p>

<p>Called the help desk today to get the Camera computer working</p>

<p>Started weekend checks</p>
