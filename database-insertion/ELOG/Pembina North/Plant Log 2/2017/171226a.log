========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Production tank ringing in on high level, Pembina said they would pump us down but having trouble with their pump.</p>

<p>Plant went to mode 3 when production tank was around 5.8 meters, shutting down re-cycle pumps</p>

<p>Lost the C3 compressor shortly after the mode 3, shut off the two speed fan</p>

<p>Equalized between production and overflow tank</p>

<p>Pembina was out to work on the hand switch for their pump (pumping again)</p>

<p>Howard Q out depressuring the WPNE line to deal with the Vermillion hydrate, had a pressure truck out to pump in methanol. WPNE line flowing again around 12:45pm</p>

<p>Man down drill based around the WPNE hydrate</p>

<p>Water froze off in the control room, have water running in old control room, hopefully will start flowing</p>

<p>Glycol levels bouncing up and down with the gas flows</p>

<p>Vermillion (Ron) called at 16:30 hrs. thinks they may be froze off again</p>

<p>Got water flowing again to the control room</p>

<p>Nigel plowing snow</p>

<p>K-203 is slowed down, C3 res gas was re-cycling</p>
