========================================
<p>TR-101 water quality still poor. Blew down both site glasses and the interface settled out at 3.5 bolts. Water still black. Batched 5 gallons of SRW66990 and recycle out of the production for most of the day to clean up.</p>

<p>Put one pump in the overflow tank around 15:30.</p>

<p>Recieved at load of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>14-03 pig came in, and V-3101 top barrel wasnt reading correclty and ESD&#39;d V-3101. Shut 14-03 inlet and pumped up glycol leg and brought the pig in. All good.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Lowered level in the reclimation tank.</p>

<p>Added ISO 150 to lean oil pump lube tank.</p>
