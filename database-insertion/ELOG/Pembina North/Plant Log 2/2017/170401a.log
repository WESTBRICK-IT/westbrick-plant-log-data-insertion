<p>Pulled PNA pig. Very waxy again. Notified Kim at Penn West. He is going to increase his chemical rates.</p>

<p>Bled down the WPNA line so Kim at Penn West could start up 16-04.</p>

<p>Methanol pumps were vapour locked. Bled them down and got them pumping again. Started to reflux from the De-eth accumulator and the tops temp slowly dropped on the tower from 7 degrees to -6.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>One pump in the overflow and the other in the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Kept in touch with Northwest today. They plan to send 5 trucks to Braz and 4 to Zeta Creek tonight.</p>

<p>Steamer came out and got the 2 culverts flowing on the Penn West road and a couple around the plant.</p>

<p>Emptied berms around the plant. (samples came back all good)</p>

<p>Glen Gunderson with GGT offloaded Bigoray oil.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk offloaded Braz water and sucked out floor drains.</p>
