========================================
<p>Recycling out of the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Opened 1&quot; recycle line off discharge of de-eth reflux pumps. &nbsp;Pumpes were getting gas locked. &nbsp;Suspect tubing line is plugged or not big enough to get the job done. &nbsp;Since opening level has flattened right out and reflux is steady.</p>

<p>Lowered methanol injection rate to 50 from 70.</p>
