========================================
<p>Thank you to the Day shift for cleaning up by the recycle pumps.&nbsp; Looks much better!</p>

<p>Have a recycle in each tank.</p>

<p>2 loads of Baccalieu brought in by HVO.</p>

<p>Called PPL. 2x to shut down the sales pumps.</p>

<p>Glycol level started to drop off, so I methanolled the inlet twice.</p>

<p>Lost the Zeta camera around 4 this morning.&nbsp; Maybe get Daren to have a look at it please.</p>
