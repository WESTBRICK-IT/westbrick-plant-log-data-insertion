========================================
<p>Added oil to K-205 govenor</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Norette hauling in Cynthia oil all night 2 different drivers, 1 orientation</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor ringing in on high 2nd stage delta pressure. Witches hat on 3rd stage suction will probably need to be pulled and cleaned.</p>

<p>Lightstream/Ridgecraft (Rael) called and said they were having issues trying to get into the Rat Creek line, called Velvet and asked them to cut back 25 decs. No way of knowing who is bringing what in and at what pressures?</p>

<p>K-104 ringing in all night on low cylinder temps, this is an issue if you let it ring in because you will miss other alarms such as K-205</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on a mystery alarm</p>

<p>Re-cycle pump &quot;B&quot; went down 1X</p>
