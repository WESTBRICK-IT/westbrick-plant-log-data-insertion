========================================
<p>Set up V-101 gas to split between here and Bigoray.&nbsp; Set back pressure control valve for gas to K-206 for 1075 KPA.&nbsp; If pressure drops below that it will continue on to Bigoray.&nbsp; If the pressure increases, then valve will open and take it to K-206.&nbsp; Vermilion was concerned about the pressure on the pipeline and asked if we could lower it.</p>

<p>Lowered amine make-up water to 6 from 10.&nbsp; Surge tank level up to 60%.</p>

<p>Dan K repaired amine charge pump, just needs to be primed and unlocked.&nbsp; Will do tomorrow when we commision it.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>GGT hauled in Zeta and Braz water and Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>Mike M installed bleed lines for water plant filters. 90% complete. &nbsp;Will commission filters tommrow.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk delivered 3m of methanol.</p>

<p>Kevin T installed new thermostats and switches for heaters in water plant.</p>

<p>Put treater heat exchanger back in service after heat soaking it and back flushing it to the boot for 3 hrs.&nbsp; DP seems to be a lot better.</p>

<p>Called Chris Winters with Vermillion and informed him of the changes we made on V-101.&nbsp; Said that Pat Brown is working tomorrow and will be opening up more wells into V-101.</p>
