========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Amine concentration @ 39.4 %</p>

<p>Howard pigging 14-3, splitter to Bigoray</p>

<p>Finished up weekend and monthly checks</p>

<p>Sped up compression</p>

<p>Re-cycle pump &quot;A&quot; went down, overloads are not tripped, but it doesn&#39;t even try to start, maybe electrical ?</p>

<p>14-3 pig came in with lots of liquids, pig came in clean</p>

<p>Got rid of an old electrical panel in the instrument shop, put into the metal bin</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauling in oil and water from Obsidian and Zeta Creek water</p>

<p>Did a man down table top drill</p>

<p>Lost coms between Pem North and Braz. Called Mike and Darren. Reset the coms at Braz. Took a few tries but randomly came back on. Possibly an issue in town.</p>

<p>Closed the Res Gas suction and discharge and c3 discharge and flagged the pin on the panel due to a gas leak on the res gas side from a valve cap possibly.</p>

========================================
<p>Howard pigged 14-03.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Battery recycle pump &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; went down when pig was coming in. Left it down due to low overflow tank levels and trying to keep sales oil temp below shutdown alarm.</p>
