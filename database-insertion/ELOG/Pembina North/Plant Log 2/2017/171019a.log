========================================
<p>&nbsp;Recycling out one pump out of both tanks.</p>

<p>Shut down booster pumps at water plant.</p>

<p>Flared lots of gas for approx 10 mins.&nbsp; Nothing rang in and all compressors stayed running.&nbsp; Nothing releaving to flare.&nbsp; Reset amine plant and clicked on sales valve and clicked on open, and flaring stopped??</p>

<p>Jason (GGT) hauled in Zeta water.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of oil.</p>

<p>Increased amine tops temp control to 39% from 38% to help get a steady reflux rate.</p>
