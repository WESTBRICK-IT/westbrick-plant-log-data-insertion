========================================
<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the oveflow tank.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Amine concentration at 40 %</p>

<p>Called Motion Canada and they will be out on Thursday to fill our breathing air around the plant</p>

<p>Changed out the filters on the Inlet Coalescer, one was blown</p>

<p>Mike M changed out the dump valve, and the PSV on the Inlet Coalescer</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in water from Braz and Zeta Creek</p>

<p>Maxxam (Mo) out to collect NGL samples from the bullet, and oil samples from PPL</p>

<p>Tri-Energy out to do some pre-fab work for the water plant filter tie in system, by-passed the fire eyes for the welder at the water plant (doing pipe supports)</p>

<p>Glycol flow control went sideways, ran in manual for a couple of hours then back to auto, all good now (this was the process upset)</p>

<p>Warmed up K-204, then swung Vermillion gas going to Bigoray back to 11-22, also opened up V-107 so we can flow (EGGS)</p>

<p>Opened up the equalizing valve at the water plant (Between the Production Tank and the Prime Tank), to give us some buffering room for tomorrows outage to tie in the new filter system at the water plant</p>

<p>Sucked out K-204 oil trench (rain water filling it)</p>
