========================================
<p>H/L low temp cold seperator rang in.&nbsp; Stroked dump valve and lowered pressure on glycol sep to 2350 kpa from 2500 kpa.</p>

<p>Raised amine reboiler tops temp control valve to 38 from 36.5 to help get steady reflux.</p>

<p>Lowered de-eth tops temp to 102 from 104 due to de-eth pressure being dropped when K-201 was fired up.</p>

<p>Production tank high leveled.&nbsp; Called Pembina pipe and asked to turn on the pumps.&nbsp; Operator said that we reached our noms for the day and pumped an extra 100 yesterday.&nbsp; So basically said NO.&nbsp; Equalized tanks to get us through to the morning.</p>

<p>Recycling out of the production tank.</p>
