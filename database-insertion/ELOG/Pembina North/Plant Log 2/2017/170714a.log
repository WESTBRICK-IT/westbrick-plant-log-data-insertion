========================================
<p>-Shut down K-205 because of a glycol leak on cyl 1, 3/4&#39;&#39; cooling tubing line leaking badly. Flagged peice of tubbing that was leaking and put in WO. Tubing was leaking from both ends and needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>-Started K-204 and put on line to sales.</p>

<p>-Pulled and cleaned recycle b screen.</p>

<p>-Changed the amine bag filter this morning&nbsp;due to high flash tank level, didn&#39;t seem to help. Suspect the plate exchanger Y&nbsp;screen may be plugging off?</p>

<p>-Recycle B is now in the truck off load line.</p>
