========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Fighting all day with the levels in the flare knockout and water flash tank, and trying to get them both to pump at the same time</p>

<p>Lowered water make-up from 12 down to 8</p>

<p>Nelson Bros (Steve) delivered 6m3 of process water</p>

<p>V-101 gave us a little grief with a false level indication and closing the inlet</p>

<p>Got the flare knockout level pumped down, and the water flash tank pump is back in auto</p>

<p>HVO (Brett) hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil</p>

<p>Orion hauled in a load of Tangle Creek oil</p>
