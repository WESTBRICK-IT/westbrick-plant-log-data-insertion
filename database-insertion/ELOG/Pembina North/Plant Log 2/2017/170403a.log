========================================
<p>Keyera TDG rep came by to do a follow up on new TDG forms etc. We left a sample copy on the table with highlighted sections that MUST be filled out by either us or the driver.</p>

<p>Shut down C3A &amp; lotto, for Dan to change second stage discharge valves, change out suction gauge by suction valve, old one was not reading correctly</p>

<p>Shut down glycol pumps, lotto, Removed the bypass valve, Mike changed out the trim, reinstalled &amp; put back in service, set flow control for bypass on manual at 47%, if on auto it bounces around still Darren &amp; Mike to look at, pressure control is on auto, &amp; VFD is on Manual at 0% seems to be good, dropped our flow to 9 m3 from 12 m3, glycol dropped off after we restarted, slowly come back, did not have to add any. Still holding at end of day.</p>

<p>HVO-hauled in load of Baccilieau oil</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 41% left make up pump at 15%, goal is 38 % concentration.</p>

<p>Lost the lean oil skid while we had the c3 and the glycol shut down.</p>

<p>One pump in the overflow the other in the production tank.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers all the way on K-201/202 compressors. Will have to pinch them in tonight.</p>
