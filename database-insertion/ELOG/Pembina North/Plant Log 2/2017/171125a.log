========================================
<p>&nbsp;Started up Lean oil, trouble getting it going for awhile, due to light ends &amp; pump vapour locking, increased fuel pressure on accumilator, finally going steady</p>

<p>C3 compressor high temps, chiller propane off pressured up to over 200 kpa, light ends ?, flared some off of the compressor for a bit, added C3, hot gas by pass control valve passing, causing chiller to pressure up, put controller in manaul at 0, still passing a little, but pressure started to drop slowly. Hot gas bypass valve in auto</p>

<p>Recycle pump B in truck offload</p>

<p>GGT Glenn hauled in a load of KCL water from Keyera 09-06-050-11-w5 service rig</p>

========================================
<p>Howard pigged WPNE and 14-03. WPNE took longer than usual to come in. Howard is aware. Pigs pulled.</p>

<p>Skimmed charcoal filter and amine reboiler. Amine looks clean.</p>

<p>Glycol concentrations are 74% and 70%. Reclimation tank is 1.5% glycol.</p>

<p>Pumped out reclimation tank.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on amine charge pump.</p>

<p>Amine reboiler valve increased from 38% to 39.5% to get reflux.</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters. New O-rings are breaking down from the produced water. Ordered viton O-rings from MRC.</p>

<p>Pumping out the flare K/O. Manage to get K/O pump working. (for now).</p>
