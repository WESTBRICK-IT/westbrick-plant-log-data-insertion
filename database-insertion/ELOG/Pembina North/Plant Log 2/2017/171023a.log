========================================
<p>&nbsp;Put both pumps in the truck offload line till midnight. Swung out, 1 pump in production 1 pump in overflow.</p>

<p>Turned on water plant pumps to get level down. Turned off once emptied.</p>

<p>Chiller temp warming up slowly. pumped up glycol leg. No change. Cycled methanol, seemed to help abit. May have to do a warm up in the future.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller deoiler, lots of lube oil.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of Tangle creek oil from Orion.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of Baccalieu oil from HVO.</p>

<p>Plant steady.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Mike Marchand repaird the exhaust valve and solinoid&nbsp;on the Air dryers.</p>

<p>-Polard out to remove old insulation on lines in the battery for inspection.</p>

<p>-Dan preped for K-102 oil change.</p>

<p>-Marty hauled in 1 load of Cynthia oil and 1 load of water from Zeta.</p>

<p>-Blue River Trucking hauled in a load of Obsidian emulsion and Zeta water.</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in&nbsp;2 loads of Baccaleau emulsion</p>

<p>-Bigoray called to say that they were blocked in on the splitter line at 5-21 and that all the east sour line was coming to Pemb North.</p>

<p>-Swung the east sour line into V-107, called Braz North and they had started K-103 compressor to take more splitter gas.</p>

<p>-Splitter gas inlet on manual and blocked in going to V-3101 to force it all to 16-35</p>

<p>-Lost K-206 on low suction, while it was down Mike wanted to look at the suction control valve to the compressor. The valve needed some work and the compressor was down for a couple of</p>

<p>hours. In the mean time Ops opened up the&nbsp;MP valve to K-203 suction to move some gas, at that time V-101 high leveled in the battery flooding out the&nbsp;MP line and shutting down K-201 and almost K-203</p>

<p>on hi liquids level. Drained the liquids through the compresor scrubbers manually. Also drained the MP header through the LP let down valve to flare.&nbsp;Fired up compression&nbsp;afterward. Everything back to normal at shift change, K-203 in HP mode as well as K-201.</p>

<p>Splitter gas is back opened up to V-3101. K-103 still running at Braz.</p>

<p>-C3-A compressor down 2 times on&nbsp; low res suction.</p>

<p>Bypassed treater exchanger during outage to help with draining liquids. Still bypassed at shift change</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps in the overflow line today throughout the shift, will need to pull from production line and possibly truck offload for a few hours&nbsp;tonight, thanks.</p>

<p>Al will be back with one more load of baccalieu&nbsp;tonight</p>

<p>Water plant pumps are on in manual at shift change</p>
