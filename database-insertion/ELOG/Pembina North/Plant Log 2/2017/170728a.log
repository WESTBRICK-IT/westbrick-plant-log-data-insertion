<p>Trouble shooting refrig system most of the night, played with chiller level, pumped up leg on level indicator, temps on C3A just keeped getting hotter, and pressure on chiller gas off would not drop, shut down lean oil to try taking load off as well, didnt help, went thru the process with Ryan, shot valves couple were about 3 -4 degs different,&nbsp; shut down C3A to start C3B, but could not get the switch gear on C3B breaker to move. left machines down.</p>

<p>Started up C3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39;. Had a hard time getting rid of c3 pressure and cooling. Opened up the hi point vent off of c3 disch to the cooler to rid of any possible non condencables. Seemed to work, c3 pressure dropped and started to cool. closed vent and pressured up again. May take a few tries to get out any c1 and c2.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Braz water and zeta water and Obsidian emulsion.</p>

<p>Left recycle pump B down due to low overflow tank levels.</p>

<p>Went to Braz to Give Gary a hand with the Tomco guys.</p>

<p>Can west delivered propane.</p>
