<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>Changed E-Log a bit today, added a new heading that is</strong></span><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"><strong> required</strong></span></span><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong> each day: Roustabout Utilization. This is to be filled out on day shifts to ease tracking and ensure training / roustabout utilization is efficient. For now nightshift can just write N/A in it until its set up a little better. Will look into the programming for conditional attributes so nightshift doesn&#39;t have to enter N/A but at the moment it&#39;s above my knowledge level.</strong></span></p>
