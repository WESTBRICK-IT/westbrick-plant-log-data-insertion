========================================
<p>HVO (Jayme) hauled in a load of Insch oil from 12-12</p>

<p>Having issues with the glycol flow and glycol levels. Running the flow control in manual, and added some glycol from the overheads, also put some methanol to the gas to gas exchanger</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Having difficulty getting the water flash tank to pump, pumped out the glycol water reclamation tank to get the water flash tank to pump</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS</p>

<p>Orion (Terrence) orientated, then hauled in 30.49m3 of Tangle Creek oil, with a water cut of 69.47%, net oil 9.310 and net water 21.18. Asked Terrence to call before bringing any more loads with regards to the amount of water that they are sending us ?</p>

<p>Set a couple of samples in the lab, but by the look of it I don&#39;t see any point in spinning them</p>

<p>Maybe see if Dan will add some engine oil to K-206, and find out what the scoop is for this Tangle Creek oil</p>
