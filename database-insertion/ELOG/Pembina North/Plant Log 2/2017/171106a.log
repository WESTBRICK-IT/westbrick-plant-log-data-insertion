========================================
<p>Trouble shooting Volcano high discharge pressures for pumps.&nbsp; Popped PSV yesterday while starting east pump to compare pressures.&nbsp; Found fuel gas blanket pressure was at 400KPA (Installed new pressure gauge, old one was faulty and reading 200KPA).&nbsp; Had Mike M set up fuel gas blanket for 320KPA.&nbsp; Pump discharge pressure now at 550KPA compared to 650KPA.&nbsp; Cleaned up glycol from PSV popping and filled out a Kits report.</p>

<p>Mike M worked on fuel gas blanket for volcano surge tank and lubricator for pumps at back of process.</p>

<p>Kevin T working on lighting through the plant and heater in ambulance shack.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in one load of Tangle Creek.</p>

<p>Water on the go delivered water.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Re-cycled from the truck offload line for 4 hours</p>

<p>Had a hard time to get the acid gas separator to pump out, lowered the pressure in the water flash tank</p>

<p>Water plant booster pumps are back in auto</p>

<p>Went up to Zeta creek to try and give Jeff a hand, K-602 2nd stage discharge PSV passing and would not seat again</p>

<p>&nbsp;Re-cycle pumps in the production and overflow tanks</p>
