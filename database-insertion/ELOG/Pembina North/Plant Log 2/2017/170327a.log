========================================
<p>Shut down K-206 and fired up K-203 so dan could install the new exhaust emissions probe, and mike to install new start gas psv.</p>

<p>Both pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>Took water samples to send to Exova.</p>

<p>Bled down the WPNA line to flare so Kim with Penn West could bring on 16-04.</p>

<p>K-206 gas bypass in manual. The PLC wont recognise the Set point. Lost the C3 compressor due to this. Also lost lean oil pump and bounced process hard. Lined out, all good.</p>

<p>Ken Leask would like us to use the charge pump at the water plant the next time that we need to pump and record how it behaves.</p>

<p>Tested the EG barrel and added it to the glycol system.</p>

<p>Caproco was out pulling corrosion coupons.</p>

<p>Skimed charcoal filters and amine reboiler. All clean.</p>

<p>South amine reflux pump was leaking. turned the pump on the the seal stoped leaking. Kept it on.</p>

<p>Took the old dayshift truck in to take back.</p>
