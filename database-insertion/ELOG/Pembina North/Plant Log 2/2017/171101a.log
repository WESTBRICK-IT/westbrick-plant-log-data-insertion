========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Added some glycol from the reclamation barrel</p>

<p>Closed the bypass around TR-101 heat exchanger</p>

<p>Fighting all night trying to get the flare knockout to pump, no luck, had to call GGT (Rob) to come suck it out, the flare knockout reading full. Rob could not get any fluid just gas. W.O. # 27772 to check level transmitter</p>

<p>Hard time to get the water flash tank to pump out</p>

<p>Booster pumps at the water plant are in auto</p>

<p>Flare K/O high level switch tripped around 08:00am. Shutting in the plant. Kicked on the flare K/O pump pumped the level down to the boot. Started plant back up after the level switch cleared. Troubleshot battery PSV to TR-101 inlet, double blocked all drain lines of pig traps, walked through battery and process and verified valves were closed ect. Level started to climb back up again after the plant was back online. Shut in the lean oil skid and the flare K/O level dropped. Swapped c3 compressor while the lean oil was down. Decicded to fire the lean oil back up again and the flare K/O level has NOT climed...??? Keep a close eye on K/O level. If climbs it could be from the lean oil or tR-101 inlet PSV on pipe rack.</p>

<p>Flare K/O pump is pumping to the boot. Nightshift keep an eye on please. Pump may also cut out and need to be tweaked. We had to open the bypass around the solenoide then slowly open the downstream valve to get it pumping, once pumping opened the rest of the way.</p>

<p>Orion hauled Tangle Creek oil.</p>

<p>HVO hauled Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>GGT hauled Braz water.</p>

<p>Water plant charge pump suction and disch valve are both closed for LOTO. However, they seem to leak abit. Nightshift, can you keep an eye on the floor drain levels please to insure they do not overflow. Thanks.</p>

<p>Kicked on water plant booster pumps to hand. Nightshift can shutdown when needed.</p>

<p>Dan K worked on water plant charge pump.</p>

<p>Kevin T and Mike M worked with assisting us in trouble shooting issues and worked at Braz the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Replaced the ticket paper at the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water from 4.5 to 3 bolts.</p>
