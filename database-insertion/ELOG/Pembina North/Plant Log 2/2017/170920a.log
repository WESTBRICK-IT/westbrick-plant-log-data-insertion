========================================
<p>&nbsp;Installed spool peice at water plant on production tank.&nbsp; Filter pots almost ready to go.&nbsp; Just need tubing lines installed for bleeds back to production tank.</p>

<p>Swung V-3101 inlet to de-but bottoms exchanger and set temp to 40C.</p>

<p>Lowered treater pressure to help V-200 liquid pump.&nbsp; Now pressure floats around what LP pressure is at.</p>

<p>V-3101 liquid line esd keeps tripping on high pressure.&nbsp; Also V-200 pump keeps tripping.&nbsp; Opened bypass around treater exchanger and backflushed through exchanger to boot for an hour.&nbsp; Left bypass open to heat soak exchanger.&nbsp; Will swing back to normal tomorrow to see if it helps.&nbsp; Kelly suspects that it could be V-101 liquids flashing off and vapour locking.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu.</p>

<p>GGT (Marty) hauled in Cynthia oil and Jason hauled in water.</p>

<p>Al Barney out welding around the plant.</p>

<p>Mike M did PM&#39;s on H2S analyzers.</p>

<p>Glen loaded oil for WPNE pig.</p>

<p>Increased amine flash tank level from 45 to 50%.&nbsp; Looked a little low in the sight glass.</p>

<p>Lowered fan speed on de-but overheads to 70% from 100%.</p>

========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Dumped liquids from the inlet coalalescer, inlet cyclone separator, de-eth overhead scrubber</p>

<p>Added propane to the C3 surge tank ( 2 bolts to 5 bolts ) south tank empty, and north tank at 30 %</p>

<p>Added oil to the acid gas compressor crankcase</p>

<p>Re-cycle pumps in the production and overflow tanks</p>

<p>Re-cycle pump &quot;A&quot; went down one time</p>
