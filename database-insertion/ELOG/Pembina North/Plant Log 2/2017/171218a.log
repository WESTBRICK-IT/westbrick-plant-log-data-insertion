<p>Informed Levi at Cynthia that we could take a couple loads of oil today.&nbsp; Also called Cara at Bigoray and gave her yesterdays volumes so she could update out noms with Pembina Pipe.</p>

<p>GGT (Glenn and Marty) hauled in Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>Lowered amine make-up to 14 from 18.&nbsp; Level up over 50% in amine surge tank.</p>

<p>Kim with&nbsp;Obsidien&nbsp;pigged 1-21.</p>

<p>Swung both recycles into the overflow tank.&nbsp; BS&amp;W seems to be holding steady.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>HVO (Jayme) hauled in a load of oil from Baccalieu 16-13-48-12 W5m</p>

<p>GGT (Marty) hauled in a load of oil from Cynthia</p>

<p>Tervita (Jay) changed out two rag bins (process and by K-206) and dropped off a pallet of rags</p>

<p>After Pembina pipe stopped pumping us,&nbsp; put re-cycle pumps in the overflow and the production tanks</p>

<p>Added propane to the C3 accumulator, started at 2.5 bolts, and finished at 8.5 bolts</p>

<p>Called Pembina pipe and they said we were already at our Nom&#39;s. Will have to see if we can get them increased</p>
