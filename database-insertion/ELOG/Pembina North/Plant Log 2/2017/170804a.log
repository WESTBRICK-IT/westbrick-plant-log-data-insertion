<p>Lost K-206 on high jacket water temp.&nbsp; Restarted and slowed down to 750RPM, and reduced suction to 550KPA.</p>

<p>Lost &quot;B&quot; recycle pump, plled basket and cleaned out(it was half full).&nbsp; Still no flow, but the monsoons came so I will pull the meter if the day shift doesnt get to it.</p>

<p>Bypassed fire eyes at Pem North and Braz due to the storm.&nbsp; Restored after the storm passed.</p>

<p>Did the Night shift truck checks and emailed off.</p>

<p>Shut down and De pressured K-203 as it was no longer needed after speeding up K-206.</p>
