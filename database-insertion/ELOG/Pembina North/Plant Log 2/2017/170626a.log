========================================
<p>Changed the inlet flow for V3101 gas from the hill, closed the valve that goes to the debute exchanger, &amp; opened the one next to it that allows it to go directly into the vessel to help cooler gas get to compressors. V3101 vessel temp was 26 * dropped to 14 *</p>

<p>Also lost the lean oil, once compressors were back up, waited for a level, restarted back on line.</p>
