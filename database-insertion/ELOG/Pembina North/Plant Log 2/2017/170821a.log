<p>Elog was down so filled in for night shift by Ryan G.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Obsidian and Zeta</p>

<p>Glycol control valve started to swing, put in manual then back into auto.</p>

<p>Glycol Accumulator level trending down.&nbsp; Added approx 2&quot; from reclamation tank and ran a methanol cycle once.&nbsp; Level shot up to 105% and bounced around all night averageing 80%.</p>

<p>Lost comms between Pem North and Zeta.&nbsp; Reset both Appolo Alto boxes, didn&#39;t help.&nbsp; Found Thernet cable unplugged from the Pem North computer.</p>

<p>Found drain valve on the level control, on the glycol sep cracked, possible leak?</p>

<p>Had no radio communication all night between the plants.</p>

<p>Pinched back blend gas flare valve to 20% to match acid gas flow rate.</p>

<p>Pumped out floor drain in the water tank.</p>

<p>lowered glycol flow rate to 5 roots from 6.</p>

<p>Apecs out to tear down Acid Gas compressor.</p>

<p>Ryan J threw the 14-3 pig.&nbsp; It came in hard with alot of fluid.&nbsp; Treater high leveled and all the inlets shut, waited 5 minutes or so and the alarm cleared and was fine afterwards.</p>

<p>Bypassed heat exchanger for a bit to get the fluid out of V-3101.&nbsp; Put it back in service this afternoon.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 and K-206 due to temp issues.&nbsp; Also pinched K-206 suction.</p>

<p>Made an appointment for the day shift truck to go into OK tire for a headlight change tomorrow.&nbsp; Will swap trucks with the night shift.</p>

<p>Core labs out to do weekly samples.</p>

<p>Put one recycle in the truck offload</p>
