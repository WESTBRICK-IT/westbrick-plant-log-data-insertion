<p>Orion hauled in a load of Tangle Creek.</p>

<p>Added propane to surge tank.&nbsp; Found equalizing valve open upon adding.&nbsp; Level in storage tank was 90%.</p>

<p>Swung recycle to overflow from truck offload and increased to 140m3/day.</p>

<p>Slowed down sales compressor 30 RPM to 770&nbsp;and increased recycle to 3400kpa from 3200kpa.&nbsp; Should help prevent losing C3 when we lose gas flows.</p>
