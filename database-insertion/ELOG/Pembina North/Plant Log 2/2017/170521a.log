========================================
<p>Lost K-3301A for no apparent reason, tried to re-start but the remote shutdown was flagged in and would not clear. Tried to start K-3301B but had the same problem with remote shutdown flagged in and not clearing. Had to call Daren F out to troubleshoot the problem, Daren found a blown fuse in back of the panel in the Instrumentation control room. Relaced the bad fuse and started K-3301A</p>

<p>Bringing the lean oil back online after our issues with the C3</p>

<p>Re-cycle pump &quot;B&quot; is in the truck offload line</p>
