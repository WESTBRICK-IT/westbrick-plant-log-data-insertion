========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in Zeta Creek water</p>

<p>HVO (Al) hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil from 16-13</p>

<p>Pembina pipe started to pump us down, but we cut wet. Put both pumps into the production tank and took samples off of the re-cycle pump and TR-101, both samples cut at 0.1 %. Called Pembina pipe back with our results, and they will send out a tech in the morning</p>
