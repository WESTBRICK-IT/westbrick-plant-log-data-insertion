========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. &nbsp;Very little oil.</p>

<p>Recycled off truck offload line, switch back&nbsp;to production tank.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Incsh oil.</p>

<p>Opened up 1-21 a couple times and pulled down line pressure then put back in manual to 5%. &nbsp;Found it produces a few extra cubes of oil when we do this.</p>
