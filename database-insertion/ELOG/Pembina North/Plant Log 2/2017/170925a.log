<p>Tye to Braz today</p>

<p>Jason with GGT hauled 4 loads of Zeta and Braz water today. Water plant ESD on hi level at the end of the 4th load. Monitored until level came down and reset the water plant.</p>

<p>HVO Brett hauled one load of Baccalieu 02-10</p>

<p>HVO Steve brought 2 loads of Baccalieu 06-12 and 01-19</p>

<p>Marty and Glen with GGT each brought a load of 03-28 Cynthia oil today</p>

<p>C3 compressor was down this morning, electrical fault kept blowing fuses on the Propane Scrubber hi level switch. Kevin Tonne worked on it today, Changed out the Solenoid to a new one. It&#39;s half prepped to run new cable back to the PLC if the new solenoid doesn&#39;t do the trick.</p>

<p>Started up the lean oil after the C3 was back up, slowly brought temp on the De-eth / De-but back up, started C3 fans, Accumulator is full</p>

<p>Core labs out to do weekly samples today</p>

<p>Treater back and front water S/G were difficult to see today (bad interface) batched a pail of DMO 46X and it began to clear up. Dumped the back water to the Water plant.</p>

<p>Lost recycle pump B once this morning due to pulling from the truck offload while an HVO truck finished off loading.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps pumping from the overflow tank at the end of shift due to high overflow level, BS&amp;W was back down to 0.00</p>

<p>Tested and pumped out the battery berm today with the trash pump.</p>

<p>Updated carseal list, Set up a page for Braz Domestic Water meter in the daily numbers spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Took the spare truck to town for Keyera ops to use during driver training tomorrow</strong></p>

<p>Ordered C3 from Canwest, storage is empty</p>
