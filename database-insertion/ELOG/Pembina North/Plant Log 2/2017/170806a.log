========================================
<p>Sped up K-206. &nbsp;Speed up K-201</p>

<p>Tightened packing on Methanol pump.</p>

<p>Increased de eth bottom temps from 104 to 108, to try and boil off more methane.</p>

<p>Glycol bouncing around most of the night, pumped methanol twice. &nbsp;Added new from the over head tank a couple of times. &nbsp;Around 2&nbsp;in the morning found a 3/4 inch valve passing on the level control on the glycol sep. &nbsp;Tried to get it to seat but would not hold. &nbsp; Will go through the task with the day shift upon arrival. &nbsp;Needed to break a carseal on the flare line to verify.</p>
