<p>As of this morning recycling out of the Overflow line</p>

<p>RBS trucks steady all night after road bans lifted (5)</p>

<p>Glycol kinda struggled most of the night. Slowly pumped from the reclaimation tank all night. Lowered the level in the glycol sep a little, raised pressure on the glycol flash tank. Seems to have come around by morning.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filters</p>
