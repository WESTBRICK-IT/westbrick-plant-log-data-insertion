========================================
<p>Acid gas well tubing pressure up to 8000 Kpa this morning. Added methanol to the discharge. Pressure slowly declined throughout the day.</p>

<p>Added antifoam to the amine contactor and amine regen systems.</p>

<p>Dumped inlet coalescer to flare.</p>

<p>Changed Lean Amine Charcoal filters.</p>

<p>Changed amine Bag filter.</p>

<p>Repaired 3 wheel cart at amine skid.</p>

<p>Shut off refridge 2 speed fan.</p>

<p>This morning the rich glycol feed pipe from glycol sep to the glycol reboiler still column was leaking at the union at the top of the still column. Tried to tighten but it was FUBAR.</p>

<p>Called AEComm - Dustin Chorney to send a couple pipe fitters (Ken Chodak and Shamus Wood) to cut and thread the piping and install a new union. (Ken and Shamus were great hands, would recommend using them again)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Built SVI - LOTO for the job and Raymond signed off</li>
	<li>Raymond called Jared to confirm the engineering and Tony to get the go ahead</li>
	<li>Had to shut down glycol system, injected methanol to the front end in the mean time. No major issues.</li>
	<li>Outage lasted aprox 4 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>Power bump today. Braz Mode 1. Tye went down to help Ryan G. fire it up. Looked like Zeta may have lost their C3 from the power bump. Our lights flickered but no equipment failures. Thanks new transformer!</p>

<p>Training at Braz with Kevin N. and Ryan G. was cancelled due to the issues today.</p>

<p>Kevin completed ADR with Raymond today.</p>
