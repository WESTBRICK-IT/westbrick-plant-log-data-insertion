========================================
<p>Adrenaline Industries Pressure truck out to bring North Pembina 4m3 of methanol. pumped 1m3 into the acid gas compressor discharge pipeline. Put the remaining 3m3 in the methanol storage tank.</p>

<p>Bled the suction lines to the methanol pumps in process to get rid of any vapour pockets when we ran out of methanol. Restarted the process methanol pump.</p>

<p>Once the 1m3 of methanol was added the acid gas compressor discharge pipeline, pressure dropped from 7300 kpa to 5950 kpa, however in the next couple hours the pressure started rising again. Topped out at 6860 kpa. Amine reboiler level was around 30% at the time. Started adding amine from the underground tank and from the overhead storage to raise the reboiler level. Added 1 inch (total) of amine from the overhead storage. Increased the amine make up pump from 7% to 10% to keep our concentration accurate.</p>

<p>Slowed down the de-but cooler fans as it cooled off last night and increased then when it warmed up a bit</p>

<p>Blew down acid gas casing pressure transmitter.</p>

<p>Pumped from the glycol reclaimation tank.</p>

<p>HVO out this morning to bring us a load of (Insch) 07-36 oil emulsion around 5am.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps still in the production tank.</p>

<p>Plant inlet coalescers were showing empty but gave them a shot to flare to ensure nothing carrying over last night while troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Orientated Vern with Adrenaline Industries lastnight.</p>

========================================
<p>Acid gas tubing pressure started climbing again. Got a methanol truck to come and push 4m3 down hole. Pressure dropped from 7400kpa down to 5900kpa. Hopefully it maintains.</p>

<p>Found both methanol pumps in process not pumping, worked at bleeding off the pressure and the de-eth overheads pump is now pumping.</p>

<p>Bob K was out and went through the new water berm release critera. The procedure is on the desk in the contol room.</p>

<p>Both pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>Check valves passing on the discharge line of the big methanol pump. Keep this in mind if needing to pump because gas will flow backwards and vapour lock the pumps if the pump times out and is left unblocked.</p>

<p>A methanol delivery will be out this evening.</p>

<p>Keep eyes peeled for issues that may be causing the acid gas well to pressure up. Thanks.</p>
