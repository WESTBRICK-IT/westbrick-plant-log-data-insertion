<p>- Water plant pipping froze from the meter to somewhere underground! Kevin found all water plant heat trace on one breaker and had tripped. Took the heat trace off the out of service line and got it turned back on. Had to get a steamer out. Water plant back online at 5:10pm. When pollard comes back theres one piece of insulation that has to go back on. Please ask them to make a hole in the end piece so we can get to the tie in point.</p>
