========================================
<p>Shut down C3 comp in the morning to do a warm up, down for an hour and temps are now -33 from -26. &nbsp;drained lots of lube oils out of the chiller.</p>

<p>Marty hauled in 1 load of Obsidian emulsion and a load of Zeta water.</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 and put K-201 on line.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201, K-202, K-206, due to the heat. &nbsp; K-206 suction was dropped to 625kpa as well.</p>

<p>Glycol rate bounced around a couple of times today and had to run it on manual for a bit.</p>

<p>Lowered top temps on the Amine reboiler as flows decreased.</p>

<p>Braz is now taking Splitter gas.</p>
