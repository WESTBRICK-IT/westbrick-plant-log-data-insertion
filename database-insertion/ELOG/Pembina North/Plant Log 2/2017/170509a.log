========================================
<p>HVO hauled in a couple&nbsp;loads of oil.</p>

<p>Lost acid gas compressor twice on high 2nd stage diff. &nbsp;Pulled old log sheets from 2013, 14 and 15 and they show 2nd stage discharge should be around 600-700 kpa with anywhere from 5-8 e3m3 going through it.&nbsp; Suspect witches hat going to 3rd stage is plugged (tagged with blue ribbon). &nbsp;Both transmitters are before witches hat so you won&#39;t see a DP. &nbsp;Either that or both suction valves are gone. &nbsp;Shot both suction valves and both are reading 41 degrees.</p>

<p>Recycling out of the overflow.</p>

<p>Kim with Penn West brought on WPNA at 7pm. &nbsp;Stayed flowing all night. &nbsp;Lowered MP to LP setpoint to 170 kpa.</p>
