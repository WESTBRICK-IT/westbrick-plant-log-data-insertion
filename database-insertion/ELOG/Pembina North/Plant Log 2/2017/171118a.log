========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Called Pembina Control to start up the pump, the level was getting high. They did inform me that we were over our noms for the day but started it anyway.</p>

<p>-The treater front water dumped was good all night and also V-101 liquid dump</p>

<p>-The k-104&nbsp;engine cyl temps started to ring in at Braz, increased the suction pressure set point on K-103 10kpa and the speed to 1150 to help take some load off K-104</p>
