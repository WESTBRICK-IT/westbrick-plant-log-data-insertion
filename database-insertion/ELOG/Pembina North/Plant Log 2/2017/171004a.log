========================================
<p>At 06:45 am Nigel and Tye while doing their rounds, discovered the oil line from Mancal V-103 and a dead leg to V-107&nbsp; to TR-101 was leaking water. They blocked in the oil dump line from V-103 and shut down the re-cycle pumps. We called Vermillion and asked them to shut in their high producing oil well, and also shut in the sour on V-200. GGT was called to come out to suck that line down, as well as Can Vac to come out to suck up the spill. Approximately 3/4 of a barrel of fluid hit the ground. The leaking line was sucked out and blinded. Connecting the V-107 ESD in the header building to Mancal ESD logic, so we can bring Mancal V-103 back on line through V-107. The re-cycle pumps will remain off until we can tie in a new spool piece, so I suggest we not take any oil until we have the new spool piece in place.</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 and started up K-201 when we lost a majority of our gas</p>

<p>The C3 &quot;A&quot; went down&nbsp;3 times on scrubber level, getting a false level indication from the chiller, blew down the de-oiler and pumped up the glycol leg on the chiller.</p>

<p>Lost the Lean oil 3 or 4 times while we were having issues with the C3</p>

<p>Lost the C3 one more time on low suction, also added propane to the C3 surge tank</p>
