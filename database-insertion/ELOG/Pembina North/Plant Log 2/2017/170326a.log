========================================
<p>Lowered amine make-up to 12 from 15.</p>

<p>Added amine from underground tank.</p>

<p>Swung recycle from truck offload to overflow.</p>

<p>Lowered amine tops temp controller to 38 from 39.</p>

<p>Water well casing pressured up to about 350 KPA. &nbsp;Once pumps kicked on, dropped to a vacuum. &nbsp;Figure it&#39;s only thermal expansion causing the pressure build-up.</p>
