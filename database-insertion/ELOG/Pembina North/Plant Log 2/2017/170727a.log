========================================
<p>-Slowed &nbsp;down K-206 and &nbsp;K-201 compressors because of JW temp</p>

<p>-Kevin &nbsp;Tonne repaired K-205 LEL head</p>

<p>-Kristina got V-104 meter talking and V-3101 meter</p>

<p>-Tye blocked in V-104 liquid dump line valve due to possible liquids seeping through the control valve and not registering on the meter.</p>

<p>-C3 system is not chilling like it should, the de-eth top temps reading high.&nbsp; we shut down AC3 for 3 hour to warm up and drain oil out of the deoiler.</p>

<p>-Pumped up the chiller level glycol leg, it was reading 10% high.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Lowered&nbsp;the chiller level set point to 40 from 45%</p>

<p>-Torc called complaining about high pipline pressure, looking around we found the air line shut in to the inlet control. Slowly bring line pack down.</p>

<p>-Lost K-202 compressor, high discharge pressure.</p>

<p>-Increased the methanol to the de-eth overheads</p>

<p>-Recieved 1 load of Baccaleau oil.</p>
