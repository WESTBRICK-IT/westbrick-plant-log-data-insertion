========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Clean.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 due to heat issues.</p>

<p>Scoped out Acid Gas LOTO for next mondays overhaul.</p>

<p>Fixed a bunch of potholes and road at water plant with bobcat.</p>

<p>Pigged splitter line from Braz to Pem North.</p>

<p>V-207 shows it dumping fluid but it didn&#39;t role over.&nbsp; Looks like on trends its dumping really slowly.&nbsp; Meter not catching it.&nbsp; Blocked in until we get a level where the dump valve opens.</p>

========================================
<p>V-207 rang in on high level. opened dump valve manually. Liquid meter rolling over. Blocked back in after it dumped. Will wait for next level alarm.</p>

<p>Had to slow K-201 down abit due to engine and compressor oil temp alarm hi. Sped back up after ambient temp dropped.</p>

<p>V-104 at Braz high leveled and ESD&#39;d. Waited for it to dump. Opened back up. All good.</p>

<p>Work ordered light inside of the sales analyser in the annex burnt out. WO#27039.</p>

<p>Jason with Blue river trucking finished offloading fluid at 18:00.</p>

<p>Mike A at Bigoray called and said they are having issues with their salt bath heater. So we had to swing V-101 gas back to Pembina North at midnight. May possibly have to take extra 5-21 gas. No word yet though.</p>

<p>Sped up K-206 due to extra gas flow.</p>
