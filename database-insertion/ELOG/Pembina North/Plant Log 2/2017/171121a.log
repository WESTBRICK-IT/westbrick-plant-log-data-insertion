========================================
<p>Kevin Tonne installed new thermostat in annex for south heaters, worked on heat trace at the battery</p>

<p>Rob T. delivered zeta creek water</p>

<p>Orion delivered one load of Tangle creek emulsion</p>

<p>HVO delivered one load of Baccalieu emulsion</p>

<p>KPA pressure truck out today (Obsidian ordered) with 2m3 of methanol to pump in on 1-21 line towards V-200 due to the line being hydrated off / ice plug forming. Put pills of methanol in on both ends and in the middle. Will have to let it sit over night and call a steamer tomorrow to finish.</p>

<p>PNA line at V-200 is shut in due to the 1-21 hydrate / ice plug. 1-21 pipeline is shut in up at the pig header due to the hydrate / ice plug.</p>

<p>Tried to open 1-21 to V-3101 today in the meantime. Was only able to get the valve 1/3 open. got mathanol communication through the valve but the valve actuator was not working correctly. Called Darkai to look at it tomorrow when they&#39;re out to work on a valve at Zeta.</p>

<p>Ordered steamer for tomorrow</p>
