========================================
<p>TR-101 gas off was flowing 10-13m3 steadily. Found the DE-eth suction scrubber dump was sticking opened. toggled it, all good.</p>

<p>Shutdown K-206 and Dan changed out the engine oil and JW thermostats.</p>

<p>Fired up K-203 to run as K-206 durning maintenance.</p>

<p>Fired up K-204 due to V-103 pressuring up. Currently have it going there to keep load off K-206 with the heat and with bringing V-101 on.</p>

<p>Marty hauled in sales oil from Cynthia.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in zeta water and Obsidian oil and water.</p>

<p>Chris page delivered bulk oil.</p>

<p>Mike M calibrating flare meter, instrument air pm&#39;s and tagging inlets vessles.</p>

<p>Core Labs came out and grabbed samples off of the c3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; compressor discharge above cooler bank, and samples c3 storage tanks.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-206/201/202. Thermostat swap on K-206 didnt seem to help.</p>

<p>Sped up De-Bute O/H cooler fans to 100% output from 70% output.</p>

<p>Bigoray was pressured up from Cynthia gas and was holding out V-101 Vermillion gas from flowing. Called them and got the OK to swing it to Pembina North for the day. Will probably swing it back tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fired recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; back up and swung it into the overflow tank. Have one pump in each tank currently.</p>

<p>No issues with the C3 compressor today. Seems to be running well.</p>

<p>Added Oil to lean oil tank</p>
