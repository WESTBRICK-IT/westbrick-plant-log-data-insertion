========================================
<p>Sped up K-201 compressor.</p>

<p>Added oil to K-205 speed governor.</p>

<p>Instrument air water knockout drum is full. Get GGT to suck out next time they are out.</p>

<p>Opened up recycle valve on glycol pumps a little bit to lower flow rate. Accumlator level was trending down since 18:00. Hasnt really helped much but its hanging around 50%. Left it and monitored.</p>

<p>Skimed amine charcoal filter. Just a slight skim of oil.</p>

<p>Recycle pump B went down. It didnt want to suck out of the truck offload line when trying to start back up. Pulled screen. Clean, but noticed it was pushed down far enough in the canister that oil wasnt flowing through it. Fixed screen. Started back up and swung into overflow from offload line.</p>

<p>Pembina must have got their power issue fixed as they started pumping at 13:00 and pumped us down all night.</p>
