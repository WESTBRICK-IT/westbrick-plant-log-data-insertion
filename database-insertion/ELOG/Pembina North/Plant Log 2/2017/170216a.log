<p>Inlets were freezing off and methanol wasn&#39;t helping so did a warm up for a couple of hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>K206 slowed down to 850 RPM due to Jacket Water temps.&nbsp; Opened up suction from 750 to 800 kpa.</p>

<p>Sales oil is wet, shut off tank mixer.</p>

<p>Treater is not getting a good interface on the water.&nbsp; Batched a pail of DMO and one pail of SCW.&nbsp; Please change out the SCW drum if you have time today.</p>

<p>Lost Recycle &quot;B&quot; pump this morning, cleaned the screen and it would not go.&nbsp; Need to pull the meter.</p>

<p>One recycle in each tank.</p>

<p>2 loads of Cynthia emulsion hauled in by Norette.</p>

<p>Brought on the Lean oil pump current rate is 160m3 a day, was set to 220 m3/d</p>
