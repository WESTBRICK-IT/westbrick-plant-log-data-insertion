========================================
<p>Pumped methanol into inlet due to chiller diff 2X.</p>

<p>Increased glycol circulation rate, from 6.5 to 7.5 to see if that helps with the freezing in the chiller.</p>

<p>Pinched K-202 (2 clicks), and K-203 louvers (top louver 1 click).</p>

<p>Glycol flow bouncing around a couple of times.&nbsp; Had to run in manual for a bit then put back in auto.</p>

<p>K-101 down at Braz, went up there with Dallas to help out.</p>
