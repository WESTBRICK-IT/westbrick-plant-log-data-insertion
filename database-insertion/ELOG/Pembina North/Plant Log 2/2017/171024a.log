========================================
<p>&nbsp;HP cold sep level climbed up a few times. Had to stroke valve and pump methanol to it.</p>

<p>Glycol flow control bounced around a couple times. Had to put valve in manual to line out.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water.</p>

<p>Recycled with both pumps out of the truck offload line till 1:30 AM.</p>

<p>Currently one pump in the overflow tank and the other in the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Closed bypass around the treater heat exchanger.</p>

<p>Turned water plant pumps off at the start of shift. Kicked pumps back on around 1:30 am.&nbsp;Pumps are still running.</p>

<p>Chiller temp was warming up throughout the night. Kicked the methanol pump on to the front end 2x and the tempature dropped 3 degrees.</p>
