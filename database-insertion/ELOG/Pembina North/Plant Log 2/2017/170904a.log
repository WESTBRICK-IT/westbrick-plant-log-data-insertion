========================================
<p>Level transmitter acting up on production tank.&nbsp; Dipped tank and found it to be approx 50cm from the top.&nbsp; Called Pembina Pipe to start pumping ASAP.&nbsp; The noms they are showing for us is only 125 and said it probably won&#39;t be undated until Tuesday.&nbsp; Asked them if they could pump 200 tonight and they agreed.</p>

<p>Chris Cartwright coming out first thing in the morning to calibrate level transmitter.&nbsp; Told him he will need to get in touch with Daren for the level by-passes.&nbsp; Leaving recycles in production until level is calibrated.</p>

<p>Lowered amine flash tank pressure to 520KPA from 600KPA.</p>

<p>Increased lean oil flow rate to 200 from 180.</p>
