========================================
<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the overflow once pembina started pumping, once Pembina shut off at 1.8 meters and the&nbsp;production tank raised to&nbsp;a level of 2.5 meters, swung&nbsp;one pump to each tank. &nbsp;Pembina kicked back on around 3.18 meters, swung both recycles back to the overflow.</p>

<p>Large oil spill/leak on K-206. &nbsp;Cleaned up with soaker pads, replaced soaker pads once. &nbsp;Suspect leak is around the air inlet at the base of the compressor that cuts over to the other side. &nbsp;Left compressor running. &nbsp;Oil levels were good. &nbsp;Dayshift might wanna call Mechanic out.</p>

<p>Increased water make-up to 12 from 9. &nbsp;Amine surge tank level down to 40%.</p>

<p>-Did some more cleaning around K-206 compressor, sucked out the gutters, looked for leaks and found nothing. Called &nbsp;Nagy and he came and had a look around k-206 &nbsp;and found no leaks as well. We blocked in the engine oil behind the panel for a couple of hours and the levels did not drop in the sight glasses. Opened back up for night shift.</p>

<p>-Cleaned more fuzz off cooler screens.</p>

<p>-Added c3 to the surge tank.</p>

<p>-The recycle pumps are both in the truck off load, we did recycle off the production tank for a few hours during the day. No problems with Pembina.</p>

<p>-Orion hauled in 2 loads of emulsion</p>

<p>-GGT hauled in 2 loads of Braz emulsion.</p>
