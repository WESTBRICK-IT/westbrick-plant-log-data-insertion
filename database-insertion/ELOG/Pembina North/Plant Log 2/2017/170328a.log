========================================
<p>Recieved two loads of Baccileau oil from HVO</p>

<p>Glycol level bounceing around, increased flash tank pressure, added from reclaim tank couple times, blew down nozzels going into exchanger, have pump slowing adding from reclaim tank still, Night Shift please check</p>

<p>Added C3 to accumilater, then lost C3 on high suction scrubber level, lots of oil on top, flared off, pumped C3 back to chiller, restarted C3, had to open manual hot gas bypass at chiller to assist to keep suction until process back to normal.</p>

<p>Lost Lean oil as well, had to flare off light ends to get it back up, slowly increased flow, all good.</p>

<p>Recycling out of overflow truck offload line.</p>
