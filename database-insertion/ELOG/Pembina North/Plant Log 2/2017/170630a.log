<p>Marty hauling Braz water.</p>

<p>Glen hauling 3-28 oil.</p>

<p>Swung both recyle pumps into shipping tank.</p>

<p>Replaced battery on the GMC spare truck.</p>

<p>Lowered K-206 suction to 800 from 900KPA to help with temps.</p>

<p>Started weekend checks.</p>

<p>Amine lean rich exchanger plugging off, flash tank was having a hard time dumping. Blew fuel gas through it to the skim tank. Seems better.</p>
