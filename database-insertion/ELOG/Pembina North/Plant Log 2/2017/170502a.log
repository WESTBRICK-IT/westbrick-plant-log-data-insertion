========================================
<p>Acid gas down due to valve change at start of shift, went thru lockout &amp; events for the day with Dayshift, Dan completed valve change on 3 rd stage, unlocked compressor, purged, checked for leaks, reset well esd&#39;s, started up, monitored, seem to help pressures a little, continue to monitor</p>

<p>Left Loto for acid gas on table, if dayshift could go thru it just to insure we didnt miss anything.</p>

<p>Plant pressured up, Hp not dumping to Lp sep, knocked down the lean oil, restarted, injected methanel x 2, pressures dropped and normal operating accured</p>

<p>Installed carseals on acid gas valves, updated the carseal list.</p>

<p>Left recycle pumps as they were.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in load of oil, will be back for second load from baccilleau</p>

<p>- K-206 down for all morning getting a service and a new govenor.</p>
