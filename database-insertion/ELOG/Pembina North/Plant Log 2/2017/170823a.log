========================================
<p>-Mike and Kevin worked on getting rid of the oil in the fuel gas line to the hot oil heater.</p>

<p>-Changed the amine bag filter.</p>

<p>-Increase the bypass on the glycol flow control to 47% from 44 to lower the flow.</p>

<p>-C3 started to &nbsp;pressure up on the chiller and the compressor would not move it. Started &nbsp;Bc3 and &nbsp;the pressure came down. Maybe bad valves.</p>

<p>-Bc3 down on high diff pressure stage 1, restarted.</p>

<p>-Lean oil is down&nbsp;</p>

========================================
<p>Mike M. pumped up the glycol leg on the chiller level control this morning. Its reading was out a bit. (it was reading a little high)</p>

<p>Mike M callibrated V-200 gas meter as per obsidian request</p>

<p>Had to slow down compression today: K-201 and K-206</p>

<p>Swung Vermillion gas from V-101 back to Bigoray today</p>

<p>Rob out to haul Obsidian water, he sucked out the sumps in process as well</p>

<p>C3 was acting up today. Started C3A this morning, de-eth overheads wouldnt come down below 10-15 C. Reflux rate was really high. HIgh C3 motor load rang in. Chiller couldnt keep up. Shut down the lean oil and dropped De-eth reboiler to 75 C. We stopped refluxing so hard and the system lined out. Started lean oil back up at only 100 m3 rate as to not hit the system so hard again. During the process likely some off spec product was dumped to the De-but. Due to this the De-but system has pressured up a bit.</p>

<p>Apecs out today to finish up the overhaul on K-5000 compressor, should be done tonight.</p>

<p>KPA out to batch 11-22 pipeline</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 128)"><strong>Nightshift please sometime tonight cut the temp to the Amine Reboiler, block the contactor dump valve and shut down the Amine circulation pump and reflux pump. This is to prepare for the Plate Exchanger swap tomorrow. Thanks.</strong></span></span></p>
