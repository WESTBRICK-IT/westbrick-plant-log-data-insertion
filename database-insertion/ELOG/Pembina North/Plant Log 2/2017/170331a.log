========================================
<p>Rob Thirsk out to deliver 4 loads of Produced water from Zeta Creek</p>

<p>Amine Regen overhead temp rang in on low temp for a minute last night (increased output to hot oil valve temporarily on the amine reboiler). Noticed reflux flow had stopped at the time as well and regen diff pressure was up to 30-40 kpa. Also the amine level in the reboiler had dropped slightly throughout the day. Assumed we were foaming a bit in the regen. Added 2L of antifoam to the regen side. Levels and pressures stabilized and returned to normal conditions afterwards.</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor discharge pressure rose to 6750 kpa during the amine regen event. Put two cycles of methanol to the AG pipeline with the process methanol pump. Pressure returned to 6200 Kpa</p>

<p>Recycling out of the Overflow line.</p>

<p>E-3102 A exchanger backed out the glycol sep causing it to high level. Then the exchanger let go causing the De-eth to high level which then high leveled the de-but causing a pressure increase, causing it to flare for abit. Increased De-bute fan speed. All good.</p>

<p>Richo guy was out to install new printer.</p>

<p>Recieved process water.</p>

<p>Have a steamer lined up for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS with Raymond.</p>

<p>Both pumps in the production tank.</p>
