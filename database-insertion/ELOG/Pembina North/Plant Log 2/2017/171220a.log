<p>Safety meeting and maintenance meeting.</p>

<p>Kevin did fire eye checks today.</p>

<p>Chris and Brandon did the C3 valves on the 2nd stage suction, weht to bring on and the coupler on the lube oil pump failed.&nbsp; Repaired and put back on line.</p>

<p>Shut down lean oil while c3 was down, start back up and only doing 110m3 a day.&nbsp; May want to speed it up.</p>
