========================================
<p>Acid gas tubing pressure climbed up again over night end of shift 6850 kpa</p>

<p>Amine Flash tank high leveled acouple of times</p>

<p>skimmed charcoal filter, clean</p>

<p>HVO delievered load of Baccileau oil from 4-28, will be back with second load from 15-10 juring dayshift</p>

========================================
<p>-The acid gas well still has high pressure, searched thouth the whole system several times looking for maybe a passing fuel gas valve that would cause that pressure. Gary W and Ryan Blair came up to help troubleshoot.</p>

<p>-We lowered the lean amine flow from 7% output at 135L/min to zero output and 129L/min</p>

<p>-Increased the acid gas discharge to flare 8000-10,000 KPA. (PSV is good to 12,411KPA)</p>

<p>-Increased the amine makeup pump from 10% output to 13% output due to a 45% concentration. May possibly be too rich in amine concentration and pulling out too much CO2 and pressuring up the well?</p>

<p>-Decreased E-5100 cooler fan setpoint from 28 degrees to 20 degrees to help speed up the internal fan.</p>

<p>-Lowered the acid gas 5125 cooler from 24 degrees down to 10 to help condence the acid gas to the well to try and assist in lowering the pressure.</p>

<p>-Changed the amine charcoal filters.</p>

<p>-Horizontal coalescer ringing in on hi DP. Darren pumped methanol into it and the one sensing has was full of hydrate.</p>

<p>-Brett hauled in 1 load of Baccalieu oil this morning after shift change.</p>

<p>-Vermillion called this morning complaining about pressure coming into V-101. Found the inlet ESD to be closed. Reset. All good.</p>

<p>-Swung the recycle into the truck offload line.</p>

<p>-Opened up K-202 louvers abit as high oil temp rang in. Will probably have to pinch back tonight to maintain 30 degrees on the inlet to the contactor.</p>

<p>-Increased the control ouput from 42-44% output on the amine regen tops temp. It was at 94 degrees and we were aiming for 96. Hasnt changed much yet tho.</p>

<p>-Mike verified the acid gas discharge temp to the acid gas well at the compressor. It is reading accuratly.</p>
