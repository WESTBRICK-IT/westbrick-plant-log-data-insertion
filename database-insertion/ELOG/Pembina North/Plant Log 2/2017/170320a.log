========================================
<p>Amine concentration at 42%. Increased the amine makeup water from 5%-7%.</p>

<p>Added from the underground amine tank due to the low reboiler level.</p>

<p>Added antifoam to the amine system (1/2 litre) Due to high acid gass well pressure and possible foaming. (seemed to bring the pressure down)</p>

<p>Pumped methanol down the acid gas well to try and lower the pressure. was bringing press down untill methanol tank went empty</p>

<p>Shut down K-205 and fired up K-204 so Dan could instal exhaust probe and so Mike could install new PSV.</p>

<p>Lost K-204 when it was swung into sales on hi JW temp due to the recycle louvers being open. Lowered temp setpoint to close the louvers all good.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk hauled in Zeta water. And blew down the casing pressure on the acid gas well with Mark Spelrem for the upcoming packer isolation test.</p>

<p>Both pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>Taggart with Baker Hughes out to drop off scale inhibitor and to take water samples.</p>

<p>Added glycol to K-205. K205 back on</p>

<p>Kent Fusion was out for a visit.</p>

<p>reclaiming glycol</p>

<p>Pressure truck should be out at 19:00 to put methanol in AG well and rest in storage.</p>

<p>Bled down the casing pressure on acid gas well twice.</p>
