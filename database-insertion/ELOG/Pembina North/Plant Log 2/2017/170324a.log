========================================
<p>- Lean Glycol 74%, Rich glycol 68%</p>

<p>- Raised AG comp temps by 2 degrees to stop them from ringing in.</p>

<p>- Mark S out with KPA pressureing up the AG casing to 7800kPa, and then went and did a packer isolation test on the water well.</p>

<p>- Replaced check valve on the water flash tank dump line going to the treater line.</p>

<p>- Recycling out of truck offload</p>

<p>- Glycol bouncing around, stroked LTS dump valve multiple times and blew down flash tank sight glass and float column.</p>

<p>- Closed hot oil into the amine reboiler from 40% to 39%</p>
