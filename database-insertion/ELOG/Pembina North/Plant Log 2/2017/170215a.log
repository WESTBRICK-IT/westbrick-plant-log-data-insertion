========================================
<p>HVO brought out a one loads of Insch oil today and a load of baccalieu oil</p>

<p>Norette hauled in loads of Cynthia oil today to cover for their treater outage.</p>

<p>Wednesday meeting today</p>

<p>Adjusted E-Log so that the Roustabout Utilization only show up on Day shifts</p>

<p>Univar out today to run operators and maintenance staff through some lean amine loading training. They brought lunch for everyone. Halfway through lunch we lost the Plant on a Mode 2. Battery PLC lost power and then we lost comms to the PLC. Plant was ESD&#39;d but held pressure.Outage lasted aprox 1.5 hrs until we managed to get comms back. Restarted compresssion, brought on inlets.</p>

<p>Amine reflux accumulator pumps vapour locked and hi leveled the accumulator and began to fill the acid gas knockout. Shut down the amine charge pumps until we could get reflux flow back (plant compression wasn&#39;t back on yet)</p>

<p>Lost C3 a couple times and got locked out on the multilin timer.</p>

<p>Had to add glycol from the reclaimation tank on startup</p>

<p>On startup Chiller and gas to gas exchanger started to freeze off, added meth</p>

<p>Pennwest sent PNA pig and had KPA batch 11-22 with corrosion inhibbitor. Did not pull pig yet.</p>

<p>Pulled Basket screen and meter on recycle pump B today. was plugged off with peices of rubber.</p>

<p>Dan K worked on Suliair air comp, changed filter and added oil</p>

<p>Kevin N stayed down here at Pem north after lumch to help out get plant back on line</p>

<p>Mike M blew down F-3102 (horizontal coalescer) differential pressure meter, pumped methanol into lines to clear hydrate material</p>
