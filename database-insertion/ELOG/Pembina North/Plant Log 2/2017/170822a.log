========================================
<p>Recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; was down. Pulled screen and it was plugged solid. Fired up. Went down on no flow. Pulled flow meter and found a big chunk of pipeline tape in the turbine. Cleaned. All good.</p>

<p>Sped up K-201 and K-206.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Very little oil.</p>

<p>Glycol seemed to line out and swing less and less through out the night.</p>

<p>Recycling out of both tanks.</p>

<p>Equalized reclimation tank.</p>

========================================
<p>Rob with GGT out to haul Obsidian, Zeta and Braz water.</p>

<p>Found a leak on the FG header on K-205 where the FG purge line for the compressor connects. There was no existing block valve between K-205 and the plant main FG header. Had to shut down the plant to depressure the FG main header to change out the leaking peice. Shut down was less than an hour. Ryan Bangle came down from Braz to help out on the shut down and start up.</p>

<p>Upon starting up we had to drain a bunch of foamy (oil) from the FG header at the Hot Oil heater. Mike and Kevin helped pull apart the regulators in the bulding to drain oil from them as well. Wasn&#39;t able to get the hot oiler running before shift change.</p>

<p>Set both recycle pumps to the Production Tank</p>

<p>Had to slow compressors down due to high ambient temp:</p>

<ul>
	<li>K-206</li>
	<li>K-201</li>
	<li>K-202</li>
</ul>
