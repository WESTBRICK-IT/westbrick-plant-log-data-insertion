========================================
<p>Recycling out of the overflow.</p>

<p>Level trend on bullet seems a little off. &nbsp;Not gaining level like it should. &nbsp;Blew down liquid leg. &nbsp;Got lots of lube oils out of it.</p>

<p>Dump line frozen on cyclone separator. &nbsp;Level at 3/4 in sight glass. &nbsp;Tried thawing out with hot water, with no luck. &nbsp;Tried dumping off the bottom with manual valve, with no luck. &nbsp;Keep eye on level, hoping warmer weather tommrow will thaw it. &nbsp;Heat trace is on.</p>
