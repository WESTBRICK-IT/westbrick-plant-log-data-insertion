<p>Weekend Checks</p>

<p>Pumped 1 bbl of SAE 40 into the overhead tank at K-202</p>

<p>Lost Recycle Pump B twice today, tape and gasket material in the turbine of the meter. Pulled meter and cleaned it both times. Also cleaned filter pot screen (was clogged both times). 2nd time pulling the filter pot noticed the edges were bent upwards and the screen was receeded into the cannister allowing larger materials to pass over top and get to the meter. Bent the edges and re-seated the screen properly.</p>

<p>Switched Recycle Pump A to the Production Tank at noon today. Currently one pump in each tank.</p>

<p>Keylink project live today, 4 Hydro Vacs out to cut the trench from the battery to the LPG building. They got most of it done and will work on cutting out the road portions tomorrow. Site Specific Orientations for the drivers / operators that needed it.</p>

<p>Marty and Glen with GGT hauling loads of oil from Cynthia today</p>

<p>Jason with GGT hauled a mixed load from Obsidian and a load of water from Zeta Creek</p>

<p>Cleaners out today</p>

<p>Pulled 14-03 pig today</p>

<p>Dropped amine make up pump to 10% from 13%</p>

<p>Changed the paper roll in the mass flow meter today, reprinted ticket for Marty is on the desk.</p>
