========================================
<p>Got a slug of gas and it rocked the de-eth tower causing it to high level then dumped hard to the debute and high leveled it. Baby sat for a while but it lined out.</p>

<p>One pump in the production tank the other in the truck offload line. started the rollover pump in the production tank.</p>

<p>Went to town to take the the 6&#39;&#39; 600 ball valve for K-203 suction scrubber to Aecom to get hydro tested, passed. Valve back up in the barrel warehouse.</p>

<p>Pinched the louvers on the acid gas compressor.</p>

<p>Increased the recirculation temp on the acid gas from 20 degrees to 22 degrees to geth 3rd stg suction tempature up.</p>

<p>V-101 high leveled for about an hour. Suspect that Vermillion pigged. No phone call.</p>

<p>Acid gas K/O scrubber high leveled, lowered pressure on h20 flash tank to get it to dump.</p>
