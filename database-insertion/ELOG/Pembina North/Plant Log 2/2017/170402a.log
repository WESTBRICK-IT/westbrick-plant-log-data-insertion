========================================
<p>Pulled Penn West 1-21 pig. Very little wax this time. Notified Kim. He came and took all of his pigs.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Both pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>Cleaners were out.</p>

<p>Amine concentration was at 44%, increased the water makeup pump to 15% output.</p>

<p>Had 2 extra Northwest trucks arrive this morning at Braz North. Seem to have a handle now on the high bullet levels.</p>
