========================================
<p>Jason with GGT out to haul a load of Obsidian water to 11-22 water plant</p>

<p>Shut down K-201 and started up K-203 in HP mode due to K-206 recycling on high discharge pressure</p>

<p>Lost K-203 this afternoon twice on over-speed, Mike M. had a look at it, gonna order a trim kit for the recycle valve. There was an error in the PLC and it didn&#39;t ring in when the compressor went down. Daren looked into it.</p>

<p>Attempted to drain the recycle line to the treater today (line we will be breaking into tomorrow). Jason with GGT sucked from both ends but couldn&#39;t get anything (problem is likely the old T-100 dead leg being plugged)</p>

<p>Called Kellys Trucking for tomorrow morning to haul the Genie Lift from North Braz to North Pem so we can complete the draining process before Keabray is out to install new spool piece tomorrow</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204 due to high oil temp</p>

<p>Opened up K-202 louvers today</p>

<p>C3 and De-but fans on high</p>

<p>Lost C3 today on overload, restarted, shut down lean oil due to C3 high overload.</p>

<p>Apecs Tyson out today to finish PM on Glycol Pump B and to do the PM on glycol pump A. Found the de-surger on pump A NFG. It is still LOTO&#39;d</p>

<p>Glycol flow control is in manual at the moment. It was swinging after the work on the pumps today</p>
