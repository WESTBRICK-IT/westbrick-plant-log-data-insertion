========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Shovelled and plowed snow all day</p>

<p>Lowered water make up from 7 to 5</p>

<p>GGT (Glen) hauled in 30m3 of oil from 15-07, and 3.80m3 oil from the flare knockout at 10-07, and 600L of oil from the skim tank</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in Braz and Zeta water</p>

<p>Cleaned out the old shift truck</p>

<p>Separator at 1-21 high levelled, and in turn slugged into V-200. Opening control valve for 1-21 gradually and gas flows seem to be coming back</p>

<p>Will have Dan look at the hydraulic hoses for the Skidsteer blade tomorrow</p>
