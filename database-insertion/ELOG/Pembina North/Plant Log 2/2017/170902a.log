<p>Sped up K-206 and K-201.</p>

<p>Glen hauled in 40m3 of cynthia oil. Had to wait awhile due to high overflow tank level.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps out of the overflow till 03:30.</p>

<p>Called pembina due to high production tank level. They will be kicking pumps on at 07:00.</p>

<p>Swung both recycle pumps at 03:30 into the production tank to ensure we are good for 07:00.</p>

<p>Called cynthia and they said that they wouldnt be hauling to us until dayshift. They will keep in touch with us during the day due to levels.</p>

<p>Plant ran good.</p>
