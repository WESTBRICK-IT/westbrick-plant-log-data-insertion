========================================
<p>&nbsp;Sped up compressors once temps cooled down.</p>

<p>Drained 3 bolts of clean amine from skim tank to underground tank.</p>

<p>Increased amine make-up water to 12 from 10.&nbsp; Also added some amine from over head tank to help increase level to 40% from 30% in amine surge tank/reboiler.</p>

<p>Oil production tank level flat lined at approx 5.8m&nbsp;again like last week.&nbsp; Drained dry leg and got some oil out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pumped glycol through with baker pump and drained.&nbsp; Level reading better now.</p>

<p>High level switch did not activate.&nbsp; Called Daren and he said that he would look at it tomorrow and increase the sesitivity of it.</p>

<p>Swung both pumps into production tank.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT delivered one load of Zeta water and one split load of Obsidian water / emulsion</p>

<p>Marty with GGT delivered 2 loads of Cynthia oil</p>

<p>CO2 Blast out today to clean out K-206, K-202, and K-201 coolers. Orientated both contractors and wrote up confined space entry permit</p>

<p>Ran K-203 to cover for K-206 and K-201 outage today, lost C3 when firing up K-203 into K-201 mode. Restarted it.</p>

<p>Keylink out to work on the elec piping at the trench in the battery, Skidsteer operator out to back fill some of the trench, Obsidian out to witness the repair to some yellow jacket coating on the exposed pipe. Cathodic line got clipped today in the trench next to the LPG building.</p>

<p>Swap one recycle pump to the overflow tank</p>

<p>Kevin Toone to repair the damaged cathodic line today</p>

<p>Serviced K-206 while it ws down and Dan hooked up the new temp JW hoses. Seems like its cycling through the extra cooler bank.</p>
