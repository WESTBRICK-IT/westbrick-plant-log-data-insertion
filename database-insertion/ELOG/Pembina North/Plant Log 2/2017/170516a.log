========================================
<p>Acid Gas flare knock out pump leaking out of packing, tightened but still weeps a little.&nbsp; WO# 26192.</p>

<p>Raised level in the glycol sep. so I could see a level in the Accumulator.</p>

<p>Increased top temp on Regen to get some reflux.</p>

<p>Lowered the water flash tank pressure to get the Acid gas knock out to pump.&nbsp; Put pressure back to previous set point.</p>

<p>Put &quot;B&quot; recycle pump on the truck off load line.</p>

<p>Sales to TCPL parts are ut to about 2.7ppm over night.&nbsp; May want to monitor.</p>

<p>Ryan Jordan with Keyera sent the 14-03 pig and it sent us a bunch of hydrates and liquids and ESD&#39;d V-3101 causing the c3-A compressor to go down. 14-03 is pressured up and hardly flowing. Ryan Jordan is going to make some calls.</p>

<p>Keylink out taking pictures of future tie in points on the bullet and in process.</p>

<p>Summer students were out getting their orientations.</p>

<p>Dan K has parts on order for the acid gas knockout pump leaking mechanical seal.</p>

<p>Pumped up the glycol leg on the lean oil.</p>

<p>Pumped up the glycol leg on the chiller.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Rob T hauled in water and condy from Braz and Zeta.</p>

<p>Mike M replaced leaking tubing on the c3&#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; compressor.</p>

<p>Swung out of the offload line. Both pumps currently in production tank.</p>
