========================================
<p>Changed amine bag filter today 10 micron normal</p>

<p>Changed gasket on Methanol Storage tank. Old one was leaking.</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000FF"><strong>Methanol pump to the De-eth is still turned off at the tail switch. It will need to be turned on by Nightshift when the tank is filled. Thanks.</strong></span></p>

<p>Rob (BRT) delivered (80/20) Glycol. 4 m3 to the storage tank (Quadra Glycol), rob then emptied the methanol storage tank at NP so we could replace the gasket on the mandoor. He will load it back up after the door is back in place an not leaking.</p>

<p>Lost recycle pump B this afternoon. Tye pulled Y-Screen and the Meter to clean.</p>

<p>Got un-announced slug of fluids in V-3101 this afternoon. Called field ops to ask if we sent a pig. Found out it was Vermillion that pigged into the WPNE line today.</p>

<p>Orientated Lewcams today. They ran up to Braz to work this morning and were back this afternoon to help with the methanol storage tank.</p>

<p>Called RBS a couple times today to question about LPG trucks that did not take loads yesterday and today. We&#39;ve been high leveled for a couple days. They ensured trucks are on the way again.</p>

<p>Updated and printed Wall charts for North Pembina and North Braz.</p>

<p>Rang in high BS&amp;W this afternoon. Switched one Recycle pump from the Overflow to the Production Tank. Will start the rollover pump tomorrow morning. (to let it pull down any water overnight)</p>
