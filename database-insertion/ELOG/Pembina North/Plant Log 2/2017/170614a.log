========================================
<p>Blew down glycol level column and raised level to 3 bolts from 1 bolt.</p>

<p>Drained lube oils off the bottom of chiller. &nbsp;Got a lot of lube oil.</p>

<p>Lowered tops temp controller to 39% from 40%.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu.</p>

<p>Orion hauled in a load of Tangle Creek. &nbsp;Truck driver said that the last load he hauled in at 5pm, he&nbsp;unloaded at the water plant??&nbsp; He said it was emulsion. &nbsp;Went down with him and showed him where to unload and how to use the mass flow meter.</p>

<p>Blocked in the equalizing line going to the water prime tank so that any water dumped to the production tank will skim any oil over to the skim tank. &nbsp;Skim tank level is at zero. &nbsp;Also noted that Orions last load of emulsion had a 30% water cut and that both loads came out of the same tank, so it could all be water. &nbsp;Not sure. &nbsp;Let production tank skim for a few days and see if we get any oil out of it. &nbsp;Keep eye on level.</p>
