========================================
<p>Slowed down Amine water make up pump to 9% from 10%.</p>

<p>Tried raising the Acid gas third stage temp by changing the louver temp to 25 from 22 degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Noticed 2nd stage discharge was getting too hot so I put it back to 22 degrees.</p>

<p>Knocked frost off the C3, Amine trim cooler, K-201 and K-202 coolers.</p>

<p>Tye spread gravel in the parking lot and road due to ice.</p>

<p>Justin watched Zeta today so Dallas could go to Braz.</p>

<p>PennWest brought on a well today and high leveled V-200.&nbsp; Noticed gas is up to 29e3m3 from 15e3m3.</p>

<p>Some CMDS today.</p>

<p>General cleanup today.</p>
