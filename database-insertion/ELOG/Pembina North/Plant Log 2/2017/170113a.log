========================================
<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil from 1-19</p>

<p>Glycol seemed to be hanging up in the glycol separator, toggled dump valve a few times and still not getting any returns. Hit the gas/gas exchanger with a little methanol and started getting returns</p>

<p>Pumped down the underground lube oil tanks south of the annex</p>

<p>TR-101 front and back water were 5 bolts plus, manually dumped down to 2 bolts</p>

<p>K-101 at Braz went down on high scrubber level on first stage</p>

========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Little oil.</p>

<p>Performed Hot Oil Heater shutdown checks.&nbsp; All good.</p>

<p>Dan repaired Lean Oil pulsation dampner.&nbsp; Lean oil is now ready to go.</p>

<p>Dan said he could smell H2S over by lean oil skid. Investigated with Dan and couldn&#39;t find anything.&nbsp; Figure it might of been the de-hy emmisons coming from the glycol system.&nbsp; Wind was blowing in the right direction.</p>

<p>Darren working on camera&#39;s and fiber optic issues.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a few loads of oil.</p>

<p>Recycling out of the overflow.</p>

<p>Kim with Penn West blocked in 16-4 yesterday.&nbsp; Gonna try getting it to flow and unload today by blocking in the other Penn West production, lowering pressure on V-200 and leaving the flare open on the pig trap for a while.&nbsp; Also shut down recycle pumps so V-200 dumps easier when slugs come in.&nbsp; WPNA flowing aroung 17 by itself at shift change.&nbsp; Leaving 1-21 and PNA shut in for the night.&nbsp; Kim will open up in the 3-13 on WPNA in the morning, hoping not to kill 16-4.</p>

<p>Mancal out to swap out a valve on their pig catcher.</p>

<p>PNA, 1-21, and 5-14 are down for the night. 5-14 is depressuring through the drain line, it&#39;s believed to be hydrated and waxed off.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Having issues with the acid gas flare knockout not dumping to the water flash tank, and then the water flash tank not dumping</p>

<p>When 5-14 gets down to 100 kpa close the drain valve on the pipeline</p>
