========================================
<p>- Glycol bouncing around went and stroked LTS valve and then later put the flow control to 15% on manual. started gaining glycol back</p>

<p>- Rob T hauling in two loads of braz water and lube oil. He went and bled down the waterwell casing pressure. Water plant did not turn on today so will continue to monitor the well.</p>

<p>- Lost all trends and comms to battery. Kristina out and reset everything. Only ones not talking are V-200&nbsp; gas, V-103 gas, and Sales after compression.</p>

<p>- Started weekend checks</p>

<p>- Took glycol sample of reclaimation tank and it is well below 10% concentration.</p>

<p>- Cleaned recycled pump b meter and screen. still out of truck offload</p>

<p>- Opened louvres on K-201</p>

<p>- Tightened packing on amine charge pump. It had a bad drip</p>
