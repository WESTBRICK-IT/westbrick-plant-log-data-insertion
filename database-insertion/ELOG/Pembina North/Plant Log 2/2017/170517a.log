<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Pumped out the amine drip tank</p>

<p>Put re-cycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the truck offload line,went down immediately, cleaned the &quot;Y&quot; strainer and pulled and cleaned the flow meter, it was plugged with plastic material</p>

<p>Water plant would not pump, changed the leads on pressure transmitters (A005 with A006) pumped down to six feet then shutdown. Found one of the pressure transmitters blocked in, maybe we did not have to change the leads ??</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in Braz and PennWest water</p>
