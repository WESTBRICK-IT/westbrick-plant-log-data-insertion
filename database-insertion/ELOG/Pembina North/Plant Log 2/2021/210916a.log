<p>9:00AM Mancal pulled out their production and sent it to zeta creek.</p>

<p>Mark S. pigged 5-21 to the plant, then shut in the Bigoray production coming to pem north at around 10:00AM (Pig pulled and clean)</p>

<p>Bypassed fire detection for the welder working outside the fence at the new Mancal riser, returned the bypass to normal.</p>

<p>Shut down K-204 and K-201 due to decreased flows.</p>

<p>Lowered the glycol injection rate from 5.6 roots (11.00m3/day) to 5.3 roots (9.90m3/day).</p>

<p>Daren F worked on the Braz north alarms that were showing on the alarm banner.</p>

<p>Daren also worked on K-201 alarms, making sure they don&#39;t continuously ring in while the unit is down.</p>

<p>Mik-Tye hauled in a load of Vermillion emulsion from 12-3-50-13W5, entered the well into the mass flow meter.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 2 loads of Mancal 14-34 emulsion.</p>

<p>Kristina will be out tomorrow to change the sales orifice plate with the decreased flows.</p>

<p>Added barrier fluid to V-200.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; down this morning, Jordi cleaned the basket strainer and pulled the meter as it was plugged with plastic.</p>

<p>Slowed down the debute fans a little to help build some pressure on the tower.</p>
