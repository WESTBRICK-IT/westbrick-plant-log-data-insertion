========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+23 Degrees Cooling To +6 Degrees, Thunder Storm &amp; Rain</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Turned off the 2 speed condencer fan due to drop in ambiant temp.</p>

<p>Had a bad Thunder Storm roll through. Had some transmitters and trends flatline and stop displaying after some lightning. The storm may have been irrelevent and could have been a fluke. Powered down 4 Digi&#39;s, 3 in maintenace office and 1 in battery MCC. No luck. Reset SCADA/EFM manager on NP1 server in maintenace office and still no luck. Daren will look into it tomorrow. May be an issue with the Digi in the battery MCC.</p>

<p>Bypassed fire eyes for the duration of the light show. Restored once it cleared up.</p>

<p>Will probably have to order up R/O water for tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Inspected jack skrews on c3 &quot;B&quot; compressor. Looking good.</p>
