========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+6 Degrees Cooling To -3 Degrees Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized and cleaned control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Dumped chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Missing glycol came back and level in glycol accumulator hanging around 105%. Raised level in the glycol sep a little to bring accumulator level down slightly.</p>

<p>Slowed down recycle pump &quot;A&quot; from 130m3/day to 100m3/day to allow for more retention time in treater and help with density. (Density is still climbing slowly and Pembina pumping).</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump barrier.</p>

<p>Water plant charge pump kicked on, inspected plunger packing after tightening it the other night. All good. Drips once every 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Lowered amine reboiler temp control valve from 38.5% to 38% as the tops temp was over 100 degrees due to drop in gas flows. Flows came back and put back to 38.5%. May need to be adjusted later.</p>
