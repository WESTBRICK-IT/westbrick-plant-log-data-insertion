========================================
<p>Weather: -40, overcast</p>

<p>-K-206 down this morning with lubricatorl problems.&nbsp; Tried getting it going with blaine but it didn&#39;t want to work.</p>

<p>-Tried firing up K-203, but the engine oil pump wouldn&#39;t fire up.</p>

<p>-Called Tyson for assistance around 5:30.</p>

<p>-Tyson worked on the lubricator system.&nbsp; Oil was super thick.&nbsp; Pulled the screen on the oil bulb, was full of thick oil, tried manually pumping the lubricators to get low flow satisfied, changed batteries on DNFT&#39;s</p>

<p>-Tyson went up and grabbed herman nelson heater from Zeta to warm up around K-206</p>

<p>-Tyson started working on K-203 and was able to get it going, switched valves in the annex to run K-203 in K-206 mode, <span style="color:#FF0000">These valves are still set up in this mode, and the recycle valve pressure setpoints are set to K-206 mode</span></p>

<p>-We figured the building temp was the main issue, wanted to fire up all gas engines in gathering to keep building warm.&nbsp; Tyson had called Nagy to come and assist as well to get additional units up and running</p>

<p>-Vocano had a tough time keeping up with heat today, glycol temp was set to 80 degrees but only maintaining 67 degrees, Devin made some adjustments to fuel gas and now temps are up to 88 degrees</p>

<p>-process analyzer was froze up, poured some hot water on line to heat it up, should be good now</p>

<p>-lost glycol level on K-204 , tried to top up level, pump had a tough time running, had to be reset a few times, got level back to normal</p>

<p>-Bad shrouding on K-203 cooler fan, Mechanics made some adjustments, <span style="color:#FF0000">please monitor sound of cooler fan to make sure fan doesn&#39;t start hitting shrouding</span></p>

<p>-K-202 went down on cylinder #2 temp, shut down, LOTO, change valves, back online</p>

<p>-Issues with fans for acid gas compressor, couldn&#39;t get it to fire up, kept tripping breaker.&nbsp; Called out Mark Stenberg, things appeared to be just too cold for fans motors to fire up.&nbsp; Had to try a bunch until temps got warmer, fans fired up and acid gas compressor is back in service</p>

<p>-Mechanics were able to get K-204 fired up, had some mechanical issues and had to change starter, back online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Both K-203, and K-204 are idling, suction blocked in with some gas pressure to keep recycling</p>

<p>-Once we started to get gas moving, C3 system and glycol pumps fired back up.</p>

<p>-purchase request submitted for driven delivery</p>

<p>-Mancal had called to bring more water into facility, turned them away due to just getting tanks emptied of bad water previously</p>

<p>-tried getting heat loop to amine drip tank moving liquids, unable to do so, may need to bleed line down again tonight</p>

<p>-hot oil heater air preheat system holding steady at 24 to 34 degrees</p>

<p>-K-202 might have been freezing up in cooler, louvers fully closed is too hot, 1 notch open is too much, we have a pair of vice grips clamped half way between fully closed and 1 notch</p>

<p>-Thank you everyone for the hard work to get the plant back online today</p>

	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">V-200 is still pulling line pack down, inlet valves in manual control, please bleed down pressure and put back to auto</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">1-21 line closed until PNA line pack is bled down, then can be opened up</span></li>
