========================================
<p><strong><em><u>-10 Mostly Cloudy, Calm</u></em></strong></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump. It was below 300 kpa. Added to 450 kpa. Will have to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st stg scrubber.</p>

<p>Increased K-203 and K-201 top and bottom louver temps by 1 degree to warm up contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Checked 5-14 trap twice. Still no pig. Notified Mark S.</p>

<p>Density low again from 8&quot; Dominion pig.</p>

<p>Called Pembina to kick on pumps as the tank was at 4.5 meters. They shut down on density (775-776). Equalized and put both pumps into the shipping tank. Tried again at 1 AM. Down on density again. (777-778).</p>

<p>Talked to Pembina control op. He said he has not been notified of new density limits and their pumps are still set to shut down below 790. May have to follow up with them today.</p>

<p>Glycol accumulator level low. Pumped from the overhead for approx 5 seconds and all the level came back. Hanging up in the column.</p>

<p>Increased amine makeup pump from 17 to 19% and cycled amine pump for 30 seconds. Trying to bring the reboiler level up abit and get it closer to the skim line.</p>

<p>Revewing training guides and will start adding to them.</p>

<p>Misc clean up around plant.</p>
