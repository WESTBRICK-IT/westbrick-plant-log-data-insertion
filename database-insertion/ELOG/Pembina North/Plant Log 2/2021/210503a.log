========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+13 Degrees Cooling To -1 Degree, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Coded and signed outstanding Neslon Bros tickets.</p>

<p>Swung recycle out of the boot vessel.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>V-200 pump trouble ringing in the odd time. Coriolis showing a flow rate when the pump is off and the valve is closed. Then when the pump kicks on and dump valve opens the flow rate goes to zero and causes the pump to shut down on &quot;pump trouble&quot;. <u><em><strong>WO#39310.&nbsp; </strong></em></u>Possibly a wax issue? may need to pump PAO into the line/ coriolis and let sit when production is shut in for upcoming compressor service.</p>

<p>Shut down the 2 speed condencer fan and left the single speed fan running to warm up amine contactor inlet and raise accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Wazzy got the 14-03 riser ESD opened up and BOL at 18:30 PM.</p>

<p>Cleaning up some garbage around the plant site, Noticing lots of rusty nails typically wherever the small shale rock was spread. (front parking area, Darens parking spot and water plant offload). Believe i got them all but keep eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Lost some braz comms and trends. Reset the little MDS breaker for braz comms in safety shack, no luck. Romeo went to Braz, EFM manager had an error. Reset EFM manager and all trending came back. After EFM manager rebooted &quot;11-22 sales ESD at Braz North&quot; &amp; &quot;Braz North sales lube oil tank hi&quot; rang in. These faulty alarms have rang in once before in the past. There is a little black LAN switch to reset in the cabinet in the Braz kitchen (North wall). Talked to John and verified he has had to reset it before a few times as well.</p>
