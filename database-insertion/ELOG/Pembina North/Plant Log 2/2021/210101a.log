========================================
<p>Sanitize control room at start and end of shift.</p>

<p>Called Pembina to start shipping at 5:30PM, they pumped 5m3 before going down on low density.</p>

<p>K-201 rang in on hi compressor oil temp, adjusted the external recycle louver linkage on the north bank to open a little more.</p>

<p>K-201 jacket water louver setpoint is at 65 degrees, found that if the louver control is in &quot;Auto&quot; it does not react properly, if the temperature hits 66 degrees the louvers open 100% and if drops to 64 degrees they close 100%, sent in a workorder to have it tuned. Put louvers in &quot;Manual&quot; for the time being WO# 38394.</p>

<p>Pinched the louvers on K-201 and K-202, 4th stage on K-202 was condensing a lot of liquids.</p>

<p>Changed the process H2S analyzer tape.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Equalized the tanks at around 9:30PM, level in the production tank was at 5.2 meters.</p>

<p>After equalizing I put both recycle pumps into the &quot;Truck Offload&quot; line on the production tank, still in the production tank truck offload line at end of shift, <span style="color:#FF0000">dayshift will have to return valving to the overflow tank if any trucked in emulsion gets hauled.</span></p>

<p>Called Pembina again at 4:20AM to try shipping again, density is hanging at .774 and they are still pumping at shift change.</p>
