<p><u><strong>-1&deg;C this morning, warming up to 16&deg;C this afternoon, clear n&#39; calm.</strong></u></p>

<p>Daren fixed K-201 issues with it going down after the startup bypass timed out, he said he had to reset the timer on his end.</p>

<p>Alex with Core lab out to grab weekly acid gas and inlet gas samples.</p>

<p>Started K-201 and loaded it, shut down K-203.</p>

<p>Kristina asked if we could dump V-107 to get rid of the splitter liquids.</p>

<p>V-107 will not dump, had Jordi go down to verify, the valve is not opening when the dump setpoints are lowered, had Daren look into it, turns out wonderware wasn&#39;t talking to the bayley, Daren fixed.</p>

<p>Rob hauled 2 loads of Cynthia produced water, 80m3 total.</p>

<p>Chris C. and Justin C. out doing gas meter calibrations.</p>

<p>Emptied out V-101 as well, notified Kristina.</p>

<p>Worked on building Zeta and Pem North online site specific orientations.</p>

<p>Increased the discharge temperature setpoints on K-201 top and bottom louvre control to 33&deg; from 27&deg; on both to raise the inlet temp to the contactor.</p>

<p>Adjusted debute fan speed through the day.</p>

<p>Blew down the horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>Turned the amine make-up pump back on, currently set at 8.</p>

<p>Turned the 2-Speed C3 condenser fan to &quot;Slow&quot;, turned on the single speed.</p>

<p>Water in the treater front water was black, blew it down and it looks a bit better now.</p>

<p><u><em><strong>+17 Degrees, Cooling To +5 Degrees. Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>Manually dumped they cyclone seperator.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Raised the amine reoiler regen valve setpoint from 32.5% to 33.5% as the tops temp was around 95-96 degrees.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; and turned off the single speed fan to raise the contactor inlet temp abit and raise the surge tank pressure.</p>

<p>Pinched manual louvers on K-201 compressor abit.</p>
