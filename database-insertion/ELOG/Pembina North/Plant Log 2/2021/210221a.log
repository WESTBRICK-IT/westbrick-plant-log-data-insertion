========================================
<p><strong>Weather: +2, clear and windy in early evening, wind died off mid evening</strong></p>

<p>-sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>-Pinch gas off V-104 to help dump liquids, back to normal</p>

<p><strong>-pinch amine drain tank heat loop valve a bit</strong></p>

<p>-snug up glycol pump packing</p>

<p><strong>-adjust res gas louver linkage a bit to open louvers more</strong></p>

<p><strong>-chiller level control changed from 10% to 10.5% to help with diff temp.&nbsp; Diff temp hanging closer to 5 degrees or more occasionally</strong></p>

<p><strong>-sped up recycle pump B VFD a little.&nbsp; Density while Pembina pumping was roughly 791 kg/m3</strong></p>

========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-1 Degrres Warming To +7 Degrees Sunny &amp; Windy</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Mark pigged the SW 8&quot;.</p>

<p>Lots of line pack from pig. Working on pulling it down. Mayb need to cut back blending accordingly if we are flowing over TCPL alarm point on combined flow.</p>

<p>Spread gravel in slippery spots.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Brazeau North and Zeta Creek water.</p>

<p>HVO trucked in a load of new Mancal production. Pumped 100 RPM slower and ticket read good again.</p>

<p>Adjusted JW and reyccle louvers on K-206 due to hi JW alarm. All good now.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan to &quot;slow&quot; and left the single speed fan going on the res gas cooler/c3 condencer to lower the accumulator pressure and the contactor inlet tempature.</p>

<p>Sped up debute overhead cooler to lower debute pressure abit.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 barrier.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the shipping tank due to 5-21 pig. Nightshift please monitor density and swing back into the overflow and recycle slow if possible. Thanks.</p>

<p>Mark pigged 1-21 line inside the Pem North facility. Lots of wax, pigged twice.</p>

<p>Raised chiller level to 11.5% to maintain temp diff. May need to drop down again when flows come down.</p>

<p>Lowered the bulk cooler fan VFD temp from 33 to 31 degrees to take some load off the chiller.</p>
