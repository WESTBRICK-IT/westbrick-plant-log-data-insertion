========================================
<p><strong><u>weather: -7, clear and calm</u></strong></p>

<p>-sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>-blow down front water sight glass for treater</p>

<p>-v-104 level high and not dumping, pinched gas off to help dump rate</p>

<p>-acid gas injection well ESD tripped, went to well and pumped up hydraulic esd&#39;s.&nbsp; No flow stopped.</p>

<p>-HVO hauled in a load of oil from mancal</p>

<p>-v-3101 got a slug at 01:00.&nbsp; had to pinch 14-3 line to get rid of fluid, all good now</p>

<p>-debute fans from 15 to 10 to increase debute pressure</p>

<p>-C3 condenser single speed fan off and 2 speed on slow</p>

<p>-lots of heat and some humidity in hot oil heater building.&nbsp; cycled switch and thermostat for exhaust fan but couldn&#39;t get it to run.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">WO# 38700 submitted</span></p>

========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-25 Degrees Warming to -2 Degrees Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber and K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Pulled 14-03 pig and WPNE pig.</p>

<p>Mark sent Dominion pig. Pulled.</p>

<p><strong>Blew down the heat loop through the amine drip tank to get it flowing again and heat up fluid in tank to be pumped out. Nightshift may need to adjust pinch back flow if its getting too hot in the drip tank.</strong></p>

<p>Nathan testing acid gas MCC smoke detectors.</p>

<p>While unloading K-206 this AM and swapping with K-203 compressor noticed that K-203 had a cold hole. Push rod broke through the valve cover. Shutdown K-203 and got apecs to repair and service it instead. More details to follow on Maximo event once mechanics review their findings.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan off and turned on the single speed to cool down amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>LPG pump lubricators stopped dripping. Blew through the tubing to free up.</p>

<p>Measurment inc out to finished proving LPG flow meters and TR-101 oil and water meters.</p>

<p>Allan out working on his welding list.</p>

<p>Devin calibrated H2S analyzers. Process and sales.</p>

<p>Lots of line pack from K-203 outage. Nightshift will have to work on pulling it down.</p>

<p><strong>Cut back amine reboiler temp control valve from 40.5% to 38.5% to cool down tops temp with the loss of gas flow. Back to 40.5%. May need to be adjusted tonight but probably not.</strong></p>

<p>Nathan replaced H2S head behind acid gas compressor.</p>

<p>Walter with Torc 780-728-5028 had approx 250 KPA higher line pressure on his line. Potential restriction. Pressure survey across piping in plant and read 280 KPA everywhere. Torc operator batched some methanol and his line pressure came down. Assuming there may have been a restriction at his end.</p>

<p>Both pumps left in the shipping tank for now to keep bringing the density up. 775 our end and 785 at their end. Then we can slowly start to recycle out of the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Staples order submitted to Jessica.</p>

<p>Homehardware bottled water delivery.</p>

<p>FYI. Lubers said if we call ahead of time they will stay open late for us to get and oil change if we are in a bind.</p>

<p>Cracked open the window, door and floor vent on the hot oil heater building to keep it cool in there until the exhaust fan is back in service.</p>

<p>New photocopier installed and in service. They will be out agaiun next week to get rid of the old one.</p>

<p><strong>K-206 suction pressure was originally set at 900 KPA. Currently its set at 850 KPA and can be increased slowly as needed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Some inlets are pinched in manual due to high line pressure. Reviewed with nightshift. (V-103, 14-03, 5-14).</strong></p>

<p>Pumped up ESD&#39;s at the acid gas well.</p>
