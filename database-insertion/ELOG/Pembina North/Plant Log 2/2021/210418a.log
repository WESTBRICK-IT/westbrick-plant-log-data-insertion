<p><u><em><strong>+1 Warming to +6, Flurries &amp; Cloudy</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Dumped amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-201 and K-202 compressors.</p>

<p>Lowered chiller level from 13% to 12%.</p>

<p>Acid gas meter at well head showing 27 degrees, usually runs around 24 degrees. Tubing pressure trend mirrors temp trend. Tubing pressure also running higher. Dropped after cooler temp from 23 to 22 degrees. Pressure and temp dropped. Aftercoooler temp may be incorrect, will get Devin to look at tomorrow.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Blew down flare stack fuel gas line knockout pot. Dry, no liquids.</p>

<p>Pembina pumped us down today. Left both pumps in the shipping tank. Core will be out tomorrow to grab sample for vapour pressure. Will start recycleing out of the overflow after that.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 compressor suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 barrier fluid reservoir.</p>

<p>WPNE will be pigged tomorrow. Mark will send after Core Labs sample has been taken off shipping tank.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute cooler fans by 10% to maintain tower pressure.</p>
