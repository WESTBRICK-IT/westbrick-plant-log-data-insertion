<p>Sanitize control room at the satrt and end of shift</p>

<p>Recycle in each tank.</p>

<p>Increased Amine reboiler temp 39% to 39.5% to increase regen tops temps</p>

<p>Increased RO water makeup to 30% to get level up in reboiler.&nbsp; Amine concentration at 4am was 39%</p>

<p>De Eth levels were bouncing around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Found methanol pump air locked and freezing off overheads, got it bled off and checked it several times throughout the night.&nbsp; Seems good now.</p>

<p>De bute went to flare a couple times due to De Eth dumoing hard to it, adjusted fans throughout the night</p>

<p>Changed Process analyzer tape</p>

<p>Sanitized shift truck for hand over</p>
