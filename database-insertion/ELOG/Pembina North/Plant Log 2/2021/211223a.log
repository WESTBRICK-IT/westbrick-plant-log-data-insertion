<p>Weather: -16, some snow throughout the day</p>

<p>-morning meeting</p>

<p>-mess around with flare knockout pump.&nbsp; fluid was better after condy soak in vessel last night.&nbsp; flush out suction line from pump and we started moving fluid, pumped level down to 10% and pump back in auto</p>

<p>-water plant load out valve still seized.&nbsp; Get some info and send to Chris.&nbsp; Chris ordered fittings and were going in for hydro testing tonight.&nbsp; Thanks Chris.&nbsp; Water plant did pump out today, seems like entrained solids have maybe settled so shouldn&#39;t cause issues until we truck in and stir things up.</p>

<p>-glycol rang in on low level in accumulator.&nbsp; Dump from glycol separator a couple times and had to add from overheads once.&nbsp; Gas flows were low and the level seems fine after flows came up a bit</p>

<p>-Tyler on site and did a thorough walkthrough of all equipment before weekend.&nbsp; All looked good</p>

<p>-Whitecap had called about high pressure, was a line that goes to Zeta now.&nbsp; Informed them of Zeta compressor issues and that they were back online and pulling line down</p>

<p>-Cathodic solutions out to check cathodic rectifier again</p>

<p>-skid steer wouldn&#39;t start, battery was dead, boosted and got going</p>

<p>-moved snow out of the way around the water plant for truck out tomorrow</p>

<p>-shovelled snow</p>
