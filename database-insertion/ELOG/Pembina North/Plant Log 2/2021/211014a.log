<p>- Louvretech out to repair louvres on K-203 and K-204 compressors.</p>

<p>- Dumped the horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>- Monitored the hot oil pump seal throughout the day.</p>

<p>- Added barrier fluid to V-200.</p>

<p>- Cleaned out Kelly&#39;s old truck Unit # 5492, will be taking it in to town tonight and picking up the Braz North truck.</p>

<p>- Jordan with baker hughes out to fill the scale inhibitor tank by the acid gas compressor.</p>

<p>- Nathan P. replaced some lighting throughout the plant.</p>

<p>- Switched over the pumps on the volcano due to a leaking seal on the west pump, east pump currently running. <span style="color:#FF0000">SR#6044435 submitted</span></p>

<p>- Turned the 2 speed C3 condenser fan off and the single speed on, switched the 2 speed on fast and the single speed off later in the day.</p>

<p><strong>- Talked with Kelly and there is the potential that tomorrow TCPL will be restricting flows to 67% of normal operation at the Cynthia and Rat Creek stations, he talked with Jessica and it sounds like we still have room for another 830e3m3 at the Rat Creek station, so Zeta will have to adjust their flows for the Cynthia station, Pem North shouldn&#39;t have to reduce flows.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- </strong>Jordi booked in the old Bigoray spare Ford for a service at Valley Fleet for tomorrow.</p>

<p>-manually dump K-201 scrubber</p>
