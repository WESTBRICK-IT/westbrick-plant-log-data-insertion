========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+34 Degrees Cooling To +15 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Idled the plant along until temps started to drop outside around 10 PM.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sped up K-206 to 800 RPM <strong>in manaul </strong>and suction at 750 RPM</li>
	<li>Sped up K-202 to 800 RPM</li>
	<li>Sped up K-204 to 800 RPM</li>
	<li>Sped up K-205 to 780 RPM</li>
	<li>Left K-203 and K-201 around 710 ish RPM</li>
	<li>Compressors running fast enough to keep line pressures low but left slowed down from usual setpoints to get abit of a head start with the heat today</li>
</ul>

<p>Hooked up the portable AC unit in the amine MCC. Turned on the wall mount unit. Blowing ice cold now. Condencer may have been froze off? Keep an eye on may have to kick it off for an hour if so.</p>

<p>TR-101 flame sensor fault. Pinched main FG to get to ignite and read hi fire then opened back up. Believe the WO is still active?</p>

<p>TR-101 front water quality poor looking after pig. Blew down a couple times. Getting better slowly.</p>

<p>Adjusted debute fan speeds as needed.</p>

<p>Increased the amine reboiler temp control valve from 33 to 35.5% once it cooled down.</p>

<p>Sullair K/O drum will need to be sucked out soon when Rob is out.</p>

<p>14-03 riser ESD. Called Wazzy. He opened back up. Hes looking into the phantom SD issues.</p>

<p>14-03 opened back up fully and pulled line pressure down through the night.</p>
