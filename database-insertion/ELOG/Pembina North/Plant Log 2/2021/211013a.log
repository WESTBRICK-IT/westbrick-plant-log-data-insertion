<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Hot oil pump seal went on P-3501 (B) East. Cleaned up and called Tyson to replace the seal. Not much oil on floor, the leak looked pretty fresh. <strong>Service request #6044344.</strong></p>

<p>Tyson getting Nathan to look at the East hot oil pump electric motor as the bearing on the top end may be going. May need to swap to the spare pump today to replace if needed. <strong>FYI &quot;hot oil low flow&quot; will have to be bypassed locally and not on the DCS.</strong></p>

<p>Left spare pump suction and discharge open incase it needs to be swapped again today.</p>

<p><strong>FYI West hot oil pump will flow approximatly 20m3/day less than East pump and amine reboiler valve may need to be adjusted.</strong></p>

<p>Bypassed the hot oil low flow switch to be able to swap pumps. Bypassed only for the duration of the pump swap.</p>

<p>Manaully dumped K-202 compressor 1st stg suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Pinched K-202 compressor louvers by 1 notch to help maintain contactor inlet temp.</p>
