========================================
<p>Fortis knocked power out at 9:15 this morning, Power came back on at 12:15pm.</p>

<p>Bringing the plant we had a couple issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Temp transmitter on K-201 cylender 4 discharge flaked out.&nbsp; Devin still working on it at shift change.&nbsp; K-202 compressor starter bendix was sticking and the LP line had a bunch of fluid in the line taking about an hour to get it drained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>lost process on LEL due to De Ethanizer pump packing failed.&nbsp; Started South pump &nbsp; Brandon on site to change out packing at shift change.&nbsp; Then we noticed hot oil was down temps cooled off enough we needed to add oil to the surge tank to get a level satisfied.</p>

<p>Ironline out to service K-206 with Tyson.</p>

<p>Cream compression cleaned the Amine trim coole, C3 cooler and K-202 cooler.</p>

<p>Rob hauled 3 loads of Zeta water</p>
