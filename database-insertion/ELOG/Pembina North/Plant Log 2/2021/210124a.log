<p><u><em><strong>-14 degrees Mix Of Sun &amp; Cloud</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Adjusted linkage on the res gas cooler to close a little tighter. One of the louvers was caught and preventing them from closing past approx 30%. Helped to warm up the amine contactor.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Sent off the winter readiness sheets for Pembina North and Brazeau North to Raymond.</p>

<p>Sorted through the outstanding Maximo work orders. Ops profiles do not have the ability to close them out. Made comments on the completed ones and set them on Jarrods desk.</p>

<p>Mark will be pigging the 4&quot; WPNE line tomorrow. Then North 8&quot;, North West 6&quot; and BNEGGS 6&quot; on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Braz North and Zeta Creek water.</p>

<p>Changed 2 sets of filters at the water plant today.</p>

<p>Shoveled snow.</p>

<p>Slowed down the debute overhead fan speed to 5% to maintain pressure and reflux with the cooler tempatures.</p>

<p>Amine concentration tested at 37%. Left the makup pump at 18.</p>

<p>Emptied catch pailes in process and compression.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water.</p>

<p>North LPG pump, West plunger lubricator line was plugged and not drippng. Disassembled and cleaned. All good.</p>
