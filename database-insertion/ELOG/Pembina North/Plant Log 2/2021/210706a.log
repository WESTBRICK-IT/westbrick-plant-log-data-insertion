<p><u><em><strong>+12 Degrees Warming To +23 Degrees, Cloudy And Clearing In The Afternoon</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Skimmed amin charcoal filter. 1/2 L.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Squeegee out water in process building.</p>

<p>Cut back the amine makeup pump from 28 to 25. Will monitor and cut back tomorrow if needed to maintain level.</p>

<p>Bulk cooler fan VFD not working. Shut down the North glycol pump and swapped VFD&#39;s to test. Mark S looking into getting a spare from Bigoray tomorrow.</p>

<p>Swapped glycol injection pumps to ensure the South one is good to run incase we need to steal the VFD for the bulk cooler until new VFD is installed. Can leave South running for now.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on the South Glycol pump.</p>

<p>Lowered the pressure in the glycol flash tank slightly from 295 kpa to 280 kpa.</p>

<p>Bumped and calibrated all the h2s monitors and labelled the faulty ones for return/replacement.</p>

<p>Added barrier fluid to V-200 pump.</p>

<p>Manually closed V-104 gas off to get it to dump. Dump valve closed back up now.</p>

<p>Nick Rothwell with Obsidian kicked on 16-4 pumpjack so we will be seeing some more fluid coming in on V-200.</p>

<p>Josh Pigged 5-14 WPNE line. Checked the trap a couple times today but nothing yet. He didnt hear the pig leave originally but verified the sender was clear. Will check again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the inlet coalescer filter.</p>

<p>Added some oil to the crankcase of the amine charge pump.</p>

<p>Devin got the GC working and cleared the faults.</p>
