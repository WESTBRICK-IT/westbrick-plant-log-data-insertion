========================================
<p><strong><u>Weather: 1 degree, calm and clear</u></strong></p>

<p>-sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p><strong>-debute fan from 20% to 23% as debute pressure was getting high</strong></p>

<p><strong>-HVO hauled in 1 load from mancal 13-34 well.&nbsp; Pulled sample, BSW of sample was way out from coriolis reading at time of sample.&nbsp; Potential lag between coriolis and the screen numbers?&nbsp; Production volume and density looked better this time.&nbsp; Didn&#39;t spin sample as everything seems to separate out pretty quickly.</strong></p>

<p>-Keylink flow rate low, called Rimbey and the were building bullet level for upcoming meter proving</p>

<p>-skim amine charcoal filter, clean</p>

<p>-empty hoil oil pump seal catch pail</p>

<p>-Top up LPG pump lubricator</p>

<p><strong>-Amine concentration at 37%</strong></p>

<p><strong>-got amine drip tank heat loop going.&nbsp; valve open 3/4-1 turn open, may need to adjust later</strong></p>

<p>-Compression building getting a little hot, opened some doors</p>

<p>-drain de-oiler</p>

<p>-Add C3 to surge tank, 4 bolts start, 8 bolts end.&nbsp; Updated usage log</p>

<p>-K-203 left bank cylinder #4 pyro straightened up around 11:30</p>

<p><strong>-temp in hot oil building seems to be good.&nbsp; 15 degrees down low, 22 degrees up by fan motor, made no adjustments</strong></p>

========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-11 Degrees Warming To +3 Degrees Sunny and Windy</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber and K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Pumped out the amine drip tank to approx 15%.</p>

<p>Skimmed and drained amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Dialed back the heat loop through the amine drip tank. Its approx 1 turn open. Fluid in tank was nicely heated and pumped out easily.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Mancal production from 13-34-49-12. Mass flow meter seemed to read accurate on the past 2 loads. Notified Kristina and Kelly.</p>

<p>Sped up recycle pump &quot;B&quot; slightly to 65 m3 approx. Density on our meter is reading 783 and approx 793 on Pembina Meter.</p>

<p>Colin with Mancal is going to inquire with his foreman about sending around 10m3 of fluid from new well down the pipeline and tanking the rest. As we have not yet recieved any of the new production down the pipline since it was originally being tanked. He will call and notify us first.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Kim with Obsidian kicked on 11-17-49-12 well into WPNA as it was down due to his ESD closing.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT hauled Braz North and Zeta Creek water.</p>

<p>Hi Flow out to prove they Keylink meter.</p>

<p>Drained the Sulfa Treat water knockout drum.</p>
