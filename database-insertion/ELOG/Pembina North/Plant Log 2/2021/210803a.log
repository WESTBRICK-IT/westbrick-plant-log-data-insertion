========================================
<p>Storm blew through with lots of lightning and no rain</p>

<p>Power bump knocked down Bc3 compressor, water plant, acid gas compressor.</p>

<p>Restarted the C3 compressor and it went down again on high discharge pressure on the res gas cylinders.</p>

<p>Lost K203 and K201 on high discharge pressure as well.</p>

<p>E-3101 froze off from lack of glycol flow, found the glycol pump vfd tripped and needed reset. Put methanol to e-3101 to thaw out. Restarted compression</p>

<p>Tightened the packings on the South eg pump.</p>

<p>Added glycol from the overhead tank.</p>

<p>Changed the amine bag filter</p>

<p>Rob hauled in 1 load of Braz oil</p>

<p>Changed the C3 2 speed fan to slow from fast</p>

<p>Cut the debute fan speed to 20% from 60%</p>
