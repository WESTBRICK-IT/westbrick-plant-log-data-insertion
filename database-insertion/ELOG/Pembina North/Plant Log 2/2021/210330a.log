<p><strong>Weather -5, clear warming to +5</strong></p>

<p><strong>-</strong>Treater basket strainer DP pressure was erratic, so pulled the strainer and had some wax but not enough to cause dp, continued to monitor</p>

<p>-Mancal came onsite to open up pig reciever, then traveled to field to send 6&quot; pig, came in with a fair amount of liquids into V-101</p>

<p>-Pulled WPNE pig from yesterday, pig was clean</p>

<p>-Glycol flows dropped off once and returned right away continued to monitor</p>

<p>-Baccalieu called while mancal was pigging about line pressure</p>

<p>-Blew down K-204 suction scrubber a couple times after the pig was in</p>

<p>-Called Jordan from Baker to come and pick up a water sample from mancal to test for compatability, he will be here in the AM</p>

<p>-Hung up new modified wallchart</p>

<p>-Shut off 2 speed C3 condensor fan and turned on single speed</p>

<p>-Put in Maximo event for Hot oil heater incident yesterday</p>

========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+6 Degrees Cooling to -1 Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 and K-201 top and bottom cooler temp by 1 degree to cool down contactor inlet temp abit.</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-202 and K-201 compressor slightly to cool down contactor inlet temp abit.</p>

<p>Swung truck offload line into the overflow tank from the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Res gas cyl#2 accelerometer ringing in on vibration. Shot valves, checked jack skrews etc. Compressor sounds fine. Transmitter seems to be faulty when looking over trends as its hitting 0mm/sec. Talked it over with Tyson T and Daren F. Daren will look into tomorrow. <strong>WO#39062.</strong></p>

<p>Raised chiller level from 11% to 11.5% to maintain the 3-5 degree temp differential.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber and K-202 1st stg suction scrubber.</p>
