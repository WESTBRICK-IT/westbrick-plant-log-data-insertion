========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+15 Degrees, Cooling To +6 Degrees, Cloudy &amp; Rain</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; and turned the single speed fan off to warm up the contactor inlet and raise the surge tank pressure. Borderline needing the second fan.</p>

<p>Lowered the debute reflux accumulator level from 50% to 45% to maintain a lower level to prevent the hi level alarm from ringing in as often.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; from the overflow to the production tank then laster had to equalize as we hit our daily noms. Pumps will be kicking on for dayshift but the time is unknown. Pembina Still fighting high tank levels.</p>

<p>Production hi tank level rang in. <strong>Tanks equalized at shift change.</strong></p>

<p>Pinched K-201 louvers half way.</p>

<p>Closed some doors in process, water plant and hot oil heater building to prevent rain from getting in.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump barrier.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the inlet coalescer as their was fluid level in the sight glass.</p>

<p>Left the amine makeup pump off for the night. <strong>Reboiler level down to 59%.</strong></p>

<p>Took water samples for berms</p>

<p>Lowered De Eth temp to 77 degrees from 79</p>

<p>Raised Debut temp from 62 to 70 degrees to try and get it to stabalize.</p>

<p>Core labs out taking weekly samples</p>

<p>Chris Page did bulk oil deliveries</p>

<p>Recycle out of Overflow tank, Pembina hasn&#39;t pumped today but we&#39;ve also been below start level.</p>

<p>Got ahold of Midwest for invoice from last load delivered.&nbsp; Scanned away.</p>

<p>Amine titration 33% left water make up pump down.</p>
