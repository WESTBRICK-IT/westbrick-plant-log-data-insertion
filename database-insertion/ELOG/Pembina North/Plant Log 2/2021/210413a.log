========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-7 Degrees Warming to +10 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Tervita out to replace 2 pyro bins and 2 rag bins.</p>

<p>Ordered process water, should be here tomorrow AM. Called Braz River to notify them.</p>

<p><strong>K-101 down for most the day at Braz North due to ignition issues.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Increased V-107 inlet pressure control from 1050 KPA to 1150 KPA to keep Ridgeback pressures low.</li>
	<li>Sped up K-201 compressor from 685 RPM to 880 RPM.</li>
	<li>Braz compressors were loaded up so line pressures werent an issue, may have needed to bump up K-206 suction to 900 KPA and K-203 RPM a little if flows picked up.</li>
	<li>Compressor BOL at 3:45 PM. All setpoints and compressor speeds back to normal at PEM.</li>
</ul>

<p>CoreLabs out to sample acid gas, inlet gas, V-200 and boot gas. (All sour samples).</p>

<p>Devin calibrating GC.</p>

<p>Inspected jack skrews and shot valves on K-3301 &quot;B&quot;. All good.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;slow&quot; to cool down the amine contactor inlet gas temp.</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-201 and K-202 compressor to cool down the amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Manually dumped amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Bumped up debute overhead cooler fan by 10% to lower debute pressure.</p>

<p>Cap on c3 &quot;B&quot; little glycol expansion tank was loose and spraying out a little glycol. Tightened cap and added a jug of 50/50. Will add more tomorrow if needed.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on spare Sullair compressor as a cold draft was blowing in keeping the building cold.</p>
