========================================
<p><strong>Weather +14&deg;C; clear. Cooling off to -1&deg;C; clear.</strong></p>

<p>Shut-off AC-3104B to build up some pressure in the C3 accumulator.</p>

<p>Drained chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>Bled off air from C3 glycol as per Tyson, foamy. Good now,</p>

<p>Added a little bit of propane from storage.</p>

<p>Set C3 LIC-3121 from 15% to 14% to help maintain temperature differential. Still bouncing around.</p>

<p>Closed K202 louver one notch to warm up the contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Open up splitter line @ 7-22 after having a conversation with Kelly. Open for approximately an hour. Production drops off even when they have one compressor down at Zeta. Isolate the Argus valve around 3 AM. Closed PIC-1070 and PIC-107 on manual at zero.&nbsp; Open it back up again around 4:15AM when flow starts coming back and pressuring up Zeta. Dropped off V-107 BPC-107 from 900 to 700 kPa. Dayshift, please monitor pressure. Thanks!</p>

<p>Slowed down K202 but sped it up again around 2:30AM when pressure starts building up on LP. Started recycling again after an hour and bouncing around.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Noticed air is leaking on one of the regulator for K201,Its in between the engine and the East wall. SR#6043208</p>

<p>Closed some doors around compressor.</p>

========================================
<p><u><strong>-1&deg;C this morning, warming up to 15&deg;C this afternoon.</strong></u></p>

<p>Took some splitter gas most of the day while K-601 was being worked on at Braz, K-601 back online at 4:30PM, shut in V-107 ESD, left the valving at 7-22 open to pem north for the time being.</p>

<p>Mik-tye hauled in a load of Vermillion 12-3 emulsion, they will be hauling in a load a day roughly, Jessica has been notified.</p>

<p>Kristina out scoping out meter flows and differentials.</p>

<p>Switched the 2-speed C3 condenser fan to slow, single speed is on.</p>

<p>Tops temp started to drop earlier this morning, increased the reboiler temp control valve from 34% to 34.5%, set it back to 34% once the splitter production was shut in.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Mancal 13-28 emulsion.</p>

<p>Jordi worked on Zeta creek site specific online orientation.</p>

<p>Mark notified us that Derek with Westbrick will be pigging 14-03 tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in a load of Zeta produced water.</p>

<p>Tyler K. serviced the water disposal pump (P-10)</p>

<p>Raymond stopped by to say hi &#128075;</p>

<p>Midwest propane delivered C3.</p>

<p>Bled some more air out of the C3 glycol cooling lines due to foaming in the expansion tank.</p>

<p>Attempted to start K-201 in place of K-203, K-201 will not stay running, once the startup bypass timer times out the unit shuts down with &quot;ESD&quot; rang in on the HMI, no other flags on the panel, will have Daren dig into it on monday.</p>
