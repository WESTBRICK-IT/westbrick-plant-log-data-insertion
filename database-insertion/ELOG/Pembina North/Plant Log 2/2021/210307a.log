========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+8 Degrees Cooling To -4 Degrees, Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Drained chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Changed amine bag filter.</p>

<p>Adjusted the linkage on the res gas cooler. Pinched it back abit to warm up contactor inlet as the cooler was running quite cold. When controler is closed louvers are about 20% open now. Looked to be about 30% open before.</p>

<p>Bumped up top and bottom cooler temp control setpoint on K-203 by 1 degree to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Discussed and reviewed procedures with Blaine H.</p>

<p>Added some oil to K-203 speed governor.</p>

<p>Pembina kicked pumps on around 03:30 AM. Density dropped from 777.5 to 770 on our meter. Assuming the 14-03 pig was the culprit. Both recycle pumps have been going steadily out of the shipping tank and verified the tank mixer is running. However, Pembina stayed running!</p>

<p>Miktye on site to haul out a load of condy to send to Tervita. Bryce will be back for a second load today.</p>

<p>Cut back the LP to boot makeup valve on K-202 compressor slightly. As the boot relief was close to opening.</p>
