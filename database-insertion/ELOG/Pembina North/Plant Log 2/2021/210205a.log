========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-7 Degrees cooling to -19 degrees heavy snow on and off</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Completed weekly report for Pem and Braz.</p>

<p>Turned off the single speed condencer fan and turned the 2 speed to &quot;slow&quot; to raise the accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Cleaned up some soaker pads around K-202 compressor.</p>

<p>Inspected jiffy clamp at water plant, all good.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow tank to pump out the Mancal oil hauled in today. Both pumps back in the shipping tank again.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>FYI Romeo said any empty pails we are ridding of (as per inspection sheet) once empty and lids removed he can take them to the used pail bin at Braz.</p>

<p>Lowered the level a little in the glycol seperator to bring up the level on the glycol accumulator and try to get it to maintain a little better.</p>

<p>Increased amine makeup water pump from 20 to 21 to maintain reboiler level/ concentration.</p>

<p>Swept off trim cooler a few times due to snow building up on screens.</p>

<p>Shoveled snow.</p>
