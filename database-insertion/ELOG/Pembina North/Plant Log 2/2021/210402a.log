========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+15 Degrees Cooling To -1 Degrees, Clear &amp; Gusty Calming Through The Night</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Light skim of oil.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Raised chiller level from 11% to 11.5% to maintain 3-5 degree tempature differential.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-201 and K-202 to maintain contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; and shut off the single speed fan to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Added a little nitrogen to V-200 pump barrier.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on glycol injection pump.</p>

<p>Tightened packing on North water plant triplex pump. approx 1 drip every 5 seconds now.</p>

<p>LPG pump packing lubricator drip rate looks good. Did not add any oil to lubricator canister so dayshift could monitor how much we are using.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute cooler fan from 65% to 45%.</p>

<p>Lowered the bulk cooler louver setpoint from 33 to 26 degrees to take some load off the chiller.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow tank until the level was down. Currently back in the production tank.</p>

<p>Skimmed and dumped the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Looked over c3 &quot;B&quot; in detail. Checked jack skrews, valves etc. All good.</p>

<p>Pembina pumps kicked on this AM then shutdown shortly after. Called them at 04:55 AM. They said they have high tank volumes they are pumping down currently and should be kicking us back on at approx 07:00 AM.</p>
