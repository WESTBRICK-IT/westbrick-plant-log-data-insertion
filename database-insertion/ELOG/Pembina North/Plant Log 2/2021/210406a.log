========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+15 Degrees Cooling To +2 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Increased V-107 inlet pressure to flow more while K-104 was down at Braz. Compressor back up at 18:00 PM.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute overhead fan speed as needed.</p>

<p>Pinched K-202 and K-201 louvers to warm up amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Both c3 condencer fans running at shift change. 2 speed was on fast. Once ambiant temps dropped Left 2 speed fan on fast turned single speed off to warm up amine contactor inlet temp and raise pressure on accumulator.</p>

<p>Inspected jack skrews on c3 &quot;B&quot; through the night. All good.</p>

<p>Al with HVO hauled in 1 load of Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Pumped out the flare knockout and recycled off the boot.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-203 and K-201 compressor once K-104 compressor was back up and line pack was down.</p>

<p>Lowered the bulk cooler louver temp and fan VFD temp setpoint by 1 degree to take some load off the chiller.</p>

<p>K-201 Kenco overfilling compressor. Drained a little oil out. will have to get Devin to look at today. <strong>WO#39111</strong>.</p>

<p>Light inside amine building above process analyser keeps turning on and off. <strong>WO#39112</strong>.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st stg suct scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped KO pot in instrument air building.</p>

<p>Truck in meter logged out when HVO was switching between pup and truck. Had to manually print ticket. Assuming it does this if meter flow shows zero for a periode of time or ground came loose? Will have to keep an eye on or talk with Daren or Devin.</p>
