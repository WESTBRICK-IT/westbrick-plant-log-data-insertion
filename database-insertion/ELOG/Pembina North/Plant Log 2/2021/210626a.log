========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+30 Degrees Cooling To +15 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st stg suct scrubber.</p>

<p>Pumped up glycol leg on K-202 4th stg scrubber.</p>

<p>Sped compression back up. Left K-205 slowed down as the recycle was still opened abit.</p>

<p>Bumped up amine makeup pump from 21 to 22. Not condencing enough during the day in the heat and loosing lots of level. <strong>Should order R/O water soon.</strong></p>

<p>Adjusted debute cooler fans as needed.</p>

<p>Ensured all compressor intakes were opened up to outside air and not the coolers.</p>

<p>Opened up the bay door in process abit to cool it off.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump lubricator canister.</p>

<p>Blew down treater sight glasses.</p>

<p>Turned the bulk cooler fan from &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;slow&quot; once it cooled down abit.</p>

========================================
<p>Start if shift clear and 16 degrees warming to 33 in the afternoon</p>

<p>Sanitized the control room am and pm</p>

<p>Amine concentration 37% increased water makeup to 24% from 22%</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mark pigged the Wolf Creek line, pig has been pulled clean</p>

<p>Increased the debute fan speed to 100%</p>

<p>Started work on weekend check</p>

<p>Wolf creek inlet control on manual output bring line pack down slowly due to extreamly high temps on compression</p>

<p>Dump the treater back water.</p>

<p>Lowered the amine regen overheads control valve output to 33% from 35</p>

<p>Lost vfd 4900 for the amine overheads condesor on temp, found the air conditioner in the mcc blowing hot instead of cool. Got it working and reset the vfd</p>

<p>K-206 suction set point lowered to 740 kpa and slowed down to 660 rpm because of high temps</p>

<p>K-205 compressor slowed down to 700 from 850 rpm</p>

<p>K-204 compressor slowed down to 700 from 850 rpm</p>

<p>K201 compressor slowed down to 720 from 755 rpm</p>

<p>K-202 Compressor slowed down 700 from 800 rpm</p>
