========================================
<p>10&deg;C this morning, 16&deg;C this afternoon, cloudy and calm.</p>

<p>- Nathan did some H2S calibrations throughout the plant.</p>

<p>- Started weekend checks.</p>

<p>- Kim with Obsidian on site to check on his 11-22 plunger well, he also pigged 7-22 to 6-22, high leveled V-200 1x.</p>

<p>- Fuel gas pressure has slowly been dropping, increased the pressure on the fuel gas regulator in the annex from 740 to 810KPA.</p>

<p>-Noticed the hot oil heater inlet and outlet temp was slowly trending down starting around 11 AM. Blew a little oil out of the fuel gas line. Trouble shooting with Nathan and Devin. Pulled tin and hard mounted screens to acess the air exchanger and cleaned it. Temps then climbed back to to normal. Will look into installing screens tighter to keep out debris. Assuming the shower today was enough to wet the debris and limit flow.</p>

<p>- Sulfatreat K.O barrel drain is open right now and is slowly draining.</p>

<p><strong>- Mark pigged 14-03, still pulling down linepack at shiftchange.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Still bringing sour production on at shift change PNA, WPNA, WPNE all in Manual.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Recycled from the Boot, still recycling from the boot at shift change.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-May need to keep an eye on the fuel gas pressure as the controller seems to be starting to drift again. Set to hold 810 ish KPA.</strong></p>
