========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+15 Degrees Cooling To -1 Degrees Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; and turned the single speed fan off to warm up amine contactor inlet and increase the c3 accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>TR-101 low temp alarm rang in. Pilot going but would trip on flame fail when main would kick on. Pulled ignitor and sensor, cleaned etc all good. Still no luck. Had to pinch back the main fuel gas to 7 psi from around 10 psi to keep in running. Flame looked quite long and blue and looks like its blowing the pilot away from the sensor. Decreasing flow slightly to the main improved the flame quality and spread. Some minor adjustments to FG regulator/ mixing bowl may be needed. Arrestor looks clean. Shawn is on call if needed (780-515-1159), we have no spare parts here but Devin has some in his truck. We will have to tell Shawn to grab them if he is needed. WO#388837.</p>

<p><strong>FYI- truck offload valves in tank farm are swung open to the shipping tank and closed to the overflow.</strong></p>

<p>Pembina density currently at 777.5 and has been climbing slowly over the past couple days.</p>

<p>Minior plant clean up.</p>

<p>Monitoring PPM&#39;s at Braz North closly through the night due to sour well being kicked back on. Ken Leask called and said Vermilion is over injecting scavenger by approx 3x reccomended rate to be safe. They will slowly decrease each day. May have to stay in contact with Christian (Vermilion).</p>

<p>Lowered bulk cooler fan VFD temp controller from 29 to 28 degrees to take some load off the chiller.</p>

<p>Skimmed and manually dumped the amine skim tank.</p>

========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+7&deg;C today, little bit of overcast, clearing up this afternoon.</strong></em></u></p>

<p>- Raised K-201 top and bottom louver setpoints to 30 from 28 to increase the contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>- Miktye (Bryce) hauled 2 loads of oil out of our production tank and hauled it to tervita.</p>

<p>- Devin called this morning to discuss the issues nightshift had with TR-101 burner, he came out and replaced the ignitor and also adjusted the pressure on the fuel gas regulator.</p>

<p>- Mark S. pigged the 14-03 pipeline, brought it in nice and easy to maintain temps on the treater, pig is pulled and clean.</p>

<p>- Slowed both recycle pumps down to 50m<sup>3</sup>/day from 100m<sup>3</sup>/day while the pig was coming in, sped back up after pig was in.</p>

<p>- Turned the C3 2 speed fan from &quot;Fast&quot; to &quot;Slow&quot; and turned the single speed fan on.</p>

<p>- Worked on weekend checks, started the backup generator and let it run for a while, dipped underground tanks, grabbed pressures on SCBA&#39;s and supplied air bottles, tested the evac horn and made sure the beacons were all flashing.</p>

<p>- Lowered the debut overheads cooler fan speed throughout the day to increase pressure on the debut.</p>

<p>- Pumped up the ESD&#39;s at the acid gas well.</p>

<p>- Monitored MP header PPM&#39;s at Braz North and Sales PPM&#39;s throughout the day, all good.</p>

<p>- Did an amine concentration, it is at 36%, left the make-up pump at 21% as the level has been coming up slowly, will do another</p>
