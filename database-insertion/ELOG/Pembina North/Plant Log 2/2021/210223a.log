========================================
<p>- Dallas with HVO hauled in a load of Mancal emulsion from 13-34-49-12, Meter read incorrectly, notified Kristina and had to estimate the water cut and net oil for the ticket, we will need to have them offload slowly when that well gets trucked in due to the high amount of light ends flashing off and the air eliminator not being able to keep up.</p>

<p>- Shut down K-206 for service and have some spools removed between the suction scrubbers and the suction bottles to inspect for strain on the piping and clean the witches hats.</p>

<p>- Keabray out to dissasemble the spools between the suction scrubbers and bottles, they found some paint that had lifted and a little bit of rust forming around the 1&quot; weldolet on the north scrubber spool, had the mechanics buff away some of the paint and noticed what appeared to be a hairline crack.</p>

<p>- Called Kelly and arranged for a mag particle inspection to be done on the spool, confirmed there was a hairline crack on the spool, had Keabray take the spool into town to be rebuilt. (CEL did the inspection.)</p>

<p>- Notified producers that the outage would be longer than intended, Called Mancal (Collin Frost), Westbrick (Derek Wazlowich), Ridgeback (Jerry Russel), Clearview (Cliff Ellis), Vermillion (Christian Nickerson and John Gilmore).</p>

<p>- Spool should be built, hydrotested and back on site around 11:00PM.</p>

<p>- Allan out to build a new handle for K-206 air bath, also welded up some cracks on the cooler fan shroud.</p>

<p>- Added glycol to the accumulator a couple times, slowed down injection rates from 6.0 roots to 5.6, lowered the level in the HP cold sep from 43 to 40%.</p>

<p>- Nathan installed new H2S heads in the acid gas compressor building and the amine building.</p>

<p>- Ben with CEL is doing a few more mag particle inspections on K-206 PSV piping, still here at end of shift, permit extended by nightshift.</p>

<p>- Recycle pump B down once, started back up with no issues.</p>

<p>- Shut in V-107 (Splitter). <span style="color:#FF0000"><strong>Control valve is in Manual at 0%.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>- </strong>Devin went to 7-11 and blew down the blend gas meter.</p>
