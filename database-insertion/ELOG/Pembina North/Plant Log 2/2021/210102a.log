<p>Sanitize control room 2x.</p>

<p>Sinopec called this evening about high line pressure, called out perry to the 6-15 ESD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perry found it was the 1-33 ESD and it was unaccessable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perry will try to get it during daylight hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinopec was down for the night.</p>

<p>Called PPL at 11pm to try and get us to pump, densuty was too low after 10m3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Equalized tanks due to high production tank level.</p>

<p>C3 2 speed fan on slow, turned off single speed fan.</p>

<p>Pumped methanol into the gas to gas exchanger to get some glycol returns</p>
