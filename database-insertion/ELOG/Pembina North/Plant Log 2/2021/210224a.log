<p><strong><u>Weather 2 degrees dropping to -6 in the morning</u></strong></p>

<p>Sanitized control room in the start and end of shift.</p>

<p>K-206 down due to spool piece out for replacement at the start of shift.&nbsp; Reviewed LOTO with Dayshift</p>

<p>Ben with CFL finished mag particle on PSV.</p>

<p>Keabray out to measure up for new spool piece.</p>

<p>Keabray and Tyson showed up around midnight to install spool piece and start up K-206.&nbsp; Back up around 2am</p>

<p>K-206 down 2x on high jacket water temp, Tyson fixed pyro and stayed running the remainder of the night.</p>

========================================
<p><u><strong>-5&deg;C this morning, warming up to 2&deg;C this afternoon</strong></u></p>

<p>- Opened the splitter back up to V-107.</p>

<p>- Mancal started slipstreaming 10m<sup>3</sup>/Day condy from their 13-34 well into the plant.</p>

<p>- Mark pigged the southwest 8&quot; from 7-7 to 5-21, took on liquids for roughly 2 hours, brought it in nice and slow to keep the treater temp high.</p>

<p>- HVO hauled in 1 load of 13-34 Mancal emulsion, he pumped it away slowly, no issues with the ticket.</p>

<p>- Nathan replaced an H2S head inside the amine building (AI-5500C), calibrated it as well.</p>

<p>- Booked in the Ford spare (Old Bigoray truck) at OK Tire for a service tomorrow and to have them look at the noisy serpentine belt.</p>

<p>- Collin Frost with Mancal would like to pig V-101 tomorrow morning, any issues his number is (780)621-7866.</p>

<p>- Jordan with Baker Hughes brought out some scale inhibitor and corrosion inhibitor, turned the chemical pump behind process back on.</p>

<p>- HVO hauled in a load of Mancal 13-28-48-13 emulsion, meter read accurately on this load as well.</p>

<p>- K-206 went down on high jacket water temp, Kristina looked into it and figures it is a faulty temperature probe, she went to Braz North and found one that we could use for replacement, Devin helped to install as well.</p>

<p>- Amine concentration is at 34%, lowered the makeup pump from 21 to 19.5%.</p>

<p>- Rob hauled in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>- Pumped up the wet leg on V-3101 upper barrel.</p>

<p>- <strong><span style="color:#FF0000">V-3101 5-21 pipeline control valve is in Manual at 70% at shift change.</span></strong></p>
