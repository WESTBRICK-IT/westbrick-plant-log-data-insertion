========================================
<p>Sanitized the control room</p>

<p>K-104 down and couldn&#39;t get it to restart, called Brandon out and he checked the govenor linkage and the starter selinoid and both were good. He found the benix housing loose on the starter</p>

<p>and tightened it back up. We then found the RTD for the compressor oil temp was reading over 1300 degrees c. Brandon the replaced the whole wiring from the panal to the compressor. Restarted K-104 and it ran good after.</p>

<p>Swapped the c3 2speed fan from fast to slow.</p>

<p>Added a little glycol from the overhead tank.</p>

<p>Completed the slips and trips inspection, no issues</p>

<p><u><em><strong>+8 Degrees Warming To +29 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Sped up debute cooler fan from 20% to 100% output.</p>

<p>Manaully dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Glycol levels came back later this AM with a vengance.</p>

<p>Rob sucked out process floor drains and sullair k/o drum and hauled Zeta water.</p>

<p>Worked on the fugitive emissions binder.</p>

<p>5-14 pigs showed up.</p>

<p>Cut back the amine makeup water pump from 25 to 22 as the reboiler level was still climbing steadily. Can adjust again tomorrow if needed.</p>

<p>Cut back the amine reboiler temp control valve from 37.5% to 36.5% during the heat of the day as the reflux and the tops temp was getting quite high. May need to adjust.</p>

<p>Mark got the spare VFD from Bigoray and installed so the second bulk cooler fan is now working. FYI both fans are running and the 2 speed is on fast.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot;.</p>
