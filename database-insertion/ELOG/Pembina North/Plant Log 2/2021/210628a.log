<p><strong><em><u>+34 Degrees Cooling To A Balmy +15 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</u></em></strong></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Checked AC units in the MCC, All good.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Sped up compression a little to pull down the line pack.</p>

<ul>
	<li>K-206 680 to 750 suction and 680 to 800 RPM</li>
	<li>K-205 700 to 780 RPM</li>
	<li>K-204 680 to 800 RPM</li>
	<li>K-202 700 to 800 RPM</li>
</ul>

<p>Added a little c3 to the refridge accumulator.</p>

<p>Increased the amine makeup water to 28% from 26%. Slowly gaining level. May need to lower flash tank level a little if needed.</p>

<p>Regulated fuel gas pressure on treater to get hi fire to initiate.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Lots of line pack pulled down through the night. Back to normal now.</p>

<p>Left the de bute cooler fans running full bore to get a bit of a head start. Maintaining around 815 KPA on tower.</p>

<p>Blew down the instrument air scrubber. K/O drum is full.</p>

<p>Adjusted the amine reboiler temp controller a little, tops temp down to 95 degrees. Valve from 33 to 35%. Kept tops around 97 to 98 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Weater clear +18 warming to a mere +37 in the afternoon, clear with very little breeze</strong></p>

<p>Added propane to the surge tank, it&#39;s at 9 bolts and there is 15% in the storage tank.</p>

<p>Mark pigged wpne line. Pig has not been pull, will pull tomorrow</p>

<p>Started slowing down all compression around 10 am, by 1pm every compressor was as low as they could run because of the hot temps.</p>

<p>Cut back on V-101 inlet to 1000 from 1200 kpa</p>

<p>Cut back the glycol flow control from 6 roots to 5, had to add a little from the overhead tank</p>

<p>Lost K-206 several times on engine glycol temp</p>

<p>Lost K-202 2 times on low jacket water pressure</p>

<p>Lost K-203 on underspeed</p>

<p>8-24 esd shut due to high pressure, night shift please call Mark Spelrem when temps cool off and line packs come down</p>

<p>Cleaned up some stained gravel around the transformer north of the amine mcc building</p>

<p>Cleaned up some oil on the floor around k-202 compressor</p>

<p>Cut back the amine regen tops temp control output from 34.5 to 30%</p>

<p>PPM&#39;S starting to climb towards the end of the day, shu;t</p>
