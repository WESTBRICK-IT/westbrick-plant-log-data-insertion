========================================
<p>Weather cloudy -13 cooling to -20</p>

<p>Sanitized the control room</p>

<p>Completed a slips and trips inspection, no issues</p>

<p>Called Hvo to arrange for a tank truck and pup to help Rob Thirsk empty out the produced water tank and haul to Travita.</p>

<p>Dump oil from the chiller.</p>

<p>Tried starting the Recycle A pump, it went down right away on vfd overload. I do believe there is a WO in to get it repaired.</p>

<p>Increased the temp set points on Tic 4800 and 4900 to 36 degrees from 35 to help slow the fan speed down a little.</p>

<p>Weather: -24, overcast</p>

<p>-Start working on LOTO package and SVI for water tank truck out line valve change.&nbsp; LOTO Valves in prep for crews</p>

<p>-Crews showed up at 8 to change valve on water truck out, changed out by 10:30 and trucks started loading</p>

<p>-Rob T hauled one load of water to secure, then got called to Zeta to haul condy here and offload into overflow tank.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">Still hauling condy at shift change.&nbsp; Will need permit extension.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">Will be hauling 500 or 600 m3 over the next few days, we need to try our best to not recycle that out, if we get a load of oil from producers, we can recycle out that volume</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">&#8203;</span>-Al with HVO hauling water.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">In the middle of his second load at shift change.&nbsp; Will come back for a third load, needs permit extension.&nbsp; If he empties the first tank we will need to isolate that tank and open up the second tank</span></p>

<p>-Pat grabbed catch trays from Zeta for placing under hose connections at water plant.</p>

<p>-service request 6047872 put in for Nathan to check out recycle pump A issues</p>

<p>-service request 6047873 put in for Nathan to check out tool crib heater</p>

<p>-Nathan looked at recycle pump A again, found a motor at Zeta and brought down in case we need to swap it.&nbsp; We sped up recycle pump to see if&nbsp;the pump just doesnt like the previous speed.&nbsp; Pump is still running at shift change and has been running for a few hours.</p>

<p>-Nathan looked at too crib heater.&nbsp; changed thermocouple and now it will call for gas, but main gas won&#39;t open up, he will check it out again when he gets back after xmas</p>

<p>-Regen tops temp was getting a little low.&nbsp; adjusted top temps controller TIC-4300 from 35% to 35.5%</p>

<p>-Temp was low at acid gas well, Pat adjusted thermostat at well from 19 to 24</p>

<p>-Wolf creek pig sent, still pulling line pack down at shift change, pig is still not pulled, can pull it tomorrow.</p>
