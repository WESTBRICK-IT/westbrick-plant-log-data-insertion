========================================
<p>Weather: -14, clear</p>

<p>-watch acid gas flare knockout, level didn&#39;t build much overnight</p>

<p>-Fill spent SCBA, couldn&#39;t fully fill it, bottles will need to be swapped out</p>

<p>-extend permits for G&amp;C steamers to offload water, new permit for additional G&amp;C truck to offload water</p>

<p>-G&amp;C brought 5 loads.&nbsp; called mancal to cancel last load as water tank was getting high and this water is plugging up filters quickly</p>

<p>-changed water filters about 7 times, was way worse while truck were offloading, waited a couple hours then tried again and was able to pump water for about 20 minutes at a time, previously filters would plug in about 2 or 3 minutes</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">Might have to discuss if we can continue to take this water at the water plant or if we should offload into overflow tank and send it through the treater.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><!--StartFragment--><u><em><strong>Weather: -10&deg;C this morning =&gt; -3&deg;C this afternoon, clear and calm.</strong></em></u><!--EndFragment--></p>

<p>- Pumped out the flare knockout and recycled from the boot.</p>

<p>- Manually dumped the De-eth overheads suction scrubber.</p>

<p>- Leo changed out water plant filters this morning, he also added a pail of SRW-6990 (Iron Chelator) to the filter pot and pumped it into the shipping tank at around 8:30AM</p>

<p>- Called Jordan with Baker and he figures we did not have enough chemical added to the shipping tank, grabbed a water sample at 11:00AM, looks like coffee (starting to clear up).</p>

<p>- Rob delivered Methanol, he is also hauling in <u><strong>Zeta Creek produced water at shift change</strong></u>.</p>

<p>- Contacted Associated Aggregates to send a priced copy for the gravel they delivered on December 1st so I could forward it to Josh Gorham.</p>

<p>- Nathan tested the emergency backup lighting in the control room.</p>

<p>- Chris C. was able to get V-107 coreolis to stop showing a flow rate.</p>

<p>- Lowered the amine makeup pump from 9% to 5% as the level in the reboiler has been climbing rapidly.</p>

<p>- Mark pigged 14-03 pipeline, pig is pulled but we are still pulling linepack down at shift change, <u><strong>slug control valve currently in manual at 45%</strong></u><strong><u>.</u></strong></p>

<p>- Adjusted the regen tops temp controller as the gas flows swung while taking the pig, <u><strong>currently at 35.5% from 34.5%.</strong></u></p>

<p>- Slowed down recycle pumps while V-3101 was dumping hard, back to normal at shift change.</p>

<p>- Sped up debute fans 5% to 35%.</p>
