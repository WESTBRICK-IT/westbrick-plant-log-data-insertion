========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-6 Degrees Warming To -1 Degres, Cloudy &amp; Light Snow</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Shutdown K-205 compressor due to hot valves on cyl#3 inboard suction and discharge. Tyson came out to replace. K-204 swapped to sales for duration.</p>

<p>Equalized production and overflow tank to get the overflow tank off the low level alarm point.</p>

<p>Pumped up wet leg on K-204 level transmitter for suction scrubber as it was reading hi.</p>

<p>Added n2 to V-200 pump barrier.</p>

<p>Blew down TR-101 front and back water sight glasses and manually dumped the back water.</p>

<p>Lowered the level in the debute reflux accum (45 to 40) and debute tower (40 to 35) to prevent the hi level nusance alarm from ringing in and out.</p>

<p>Manually dumped horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>Rimby BOL however they are fighting levels. Out bullet level is 42% and 242m3. Started too cool the plant back back down as we have ample bullet level.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Raised the chiller level from 9.5% to 10.5%.&nbsp; (Around 13.5% is normal.)</li>
	<li>Lowered de eth bottoms temp from 80 degrees to 78 degrees (back to normal)</li>
	<li>Manually opening refridge suction and pinching hot gas bypass at shift change. (Suction was around 55 KPA and hot gas was around 43 KPA during normal operation and both in auto)</li>
</ul>
