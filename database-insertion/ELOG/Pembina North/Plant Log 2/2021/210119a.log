<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Pulled 5-14 pig.</p>

<p>Perry pigged North and North West laterals and the BNEGGS line.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Zeta water.</p>

<p>Filter pot drain line just upstream of the suction valve on Wilden pump at the water plant has a pin hole leak. Got rob to suck out the filter pot so we could change filters. Have a pipe clamp being delivered tomorrow. Maximo event #19561.</p>

<p>Equalized shipping and overflow tank to get the overflow off alarm point on low level.</p>

<p>Turned off the single speed condencer fan and turned the 2 speed on &quot;fast&quot; to lower the contactor inlet temp and the c3 accululator temp.</p>

<p>Working with Blaine over the phone. Hes starting to work on training guides.</p>

<p>Mark S and Devin fixed K-206 compressor oil temp transmitter. It was jumping around all over the place.</p>

<p>Added pressure to the amine skim tank then skimmed and dumped.</p>

<p>Opened up some doors in the amine building to cool it down. Can close up tonight.</p>
