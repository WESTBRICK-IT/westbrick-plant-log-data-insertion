<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Rob hauling Braz water.</p>

<p>Mark pigged 14-03.</p>

<p>Opened louvers all the way on K-201 and K-202 compressor.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan to &quot;fast&quot;</p>

<p>Raised South tarps on the trim cooler to cool down the &quot;lean amine temp&quot; a little and opened up East side louvers 1 notch.</p>

<p>Raymond called this afternoon due to recieving a letter from Pembina from high vapour pressure. Both pumps have been in the shipping tank for the past 2 days.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Called Core Labs and have them line up for a sample. Results will be in Tuesday on a rush.</li>
	<li>Called Brian Dezniak with Vermilion 780-514-0732 to get approval to truck to them if hi tank levels become an issue. (requested to call him to let him know if/when we have a truck coming).</li>
	<li>Called Miktye Trucking to ensure they have trucks avalible if needed and they do. Bryce and Marty are already orientated. Vermilion prefers we use them but gave approval for GGT if Miktye is unavalible.</li>
	<li>Pembina kicked their pumps on again this afternoon and pumped us down more. Have not recieved any calls from them.</li>
	<li><u><em><strong>Currently equalizing tanks</strong></em></u>. Letting the shipping tank fill with fresh production fluid then will slowly recycle out of the overflow tank and blend back in over the next day or 2.</li>
</ul>
