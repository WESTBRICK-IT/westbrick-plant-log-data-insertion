========================================
<p>Blew down V-103 level transmitter</p>

<p>Josh pigged WPNE, not pulled</p>

<p>slowed debut fan from 30 to 20</p>

<p>Mancal flow down for a bit to pull their downhole choke</p>

<p>WO-39060 in to change the H2 bottle on the GC</p>

<p>GGT hauled H2O and emptied lube oil bbls</p>

<p>Zeta increased the CO2 blend to 280</p>

<p>Contact collected an H2O sample for Ridgeback</p>

<p>Tyson took oil samples and did a walk through</p>

<p>tried to switch hot oil pumps to take an oil sample, lost the hot oil heater on low flow and could not restart, Daren and Devin working on it, Found a metal tag blocking the actuator for the inlet air from moving properly and locking us out on M D limit open.</p>

<p>plant went sour, shut in all inlets, lost k206,205,202 and the AG comp</p>

<p>shutdown at about 13:00 starting back up at 15:30</p>

<p>Brian N came down to help out. Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Mancal will be pigging tommorow</strong></p>

<p><strong>5-21 inlet still pinched back at shift change</strong></p>

<p>increased amine regen temp control from 39.5 to 40.5</p>
