<p>-called shawn to come out this morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-hot oil heater went down on flame fail, started up</p>

<p>-Shawn showed up and we were able to see what happens when it went down, found there was ice in air intake obstructing control of fuel/ air mix.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>there was hot oil going to the air preheater, but not enough.&nbsp; valve showed open but there was issues with the actuator.&nbsp; removed actuator, no spare parts.&nbsp; Devin will look for parts on monday.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">control oil to air heater with manual valve, will just have to monitor temps, there is temp shutdowns for the air temperature high (60 degrees)&nbsp; just adjust valve needed.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>-Pull wolf creek pig</p>

<p>-Amine concentration at 34%</p>

<p>-cut new filters for hot oil heater air intake and replaced the old ones</p>

<p>-adjusted res gas louvers so they close completely</p>

<p>-weekend checks</p>

<p>-Rob T hauled in 2 loads of condensate from Zeta</p>
