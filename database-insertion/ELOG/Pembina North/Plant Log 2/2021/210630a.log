<p>- Adjusted the regen tops temp controller throughout the day, currently at 32%.</p>

<p>- Slowed down all compressors this morning, pinched suction on K-206 continuously until it went down on High jacket water temp at 12:40PM, shut down K-203 and switched it to K-206 mode, set the suction recycle setpoint to 500KPA from 1000KPA and the discharge recycle setpoint to 2600KPA from 5950KPA.</p>

<p>- Cleaned the intake screens on the sullair compressor.</p>

<p>- Mark S. and Shannon H. worked down at the 3-27 water injection well today and did the acid squeeze, Mark said we will be good to start injecting again at 5:30PM.</p>

<p>- Closed the gas off of V-101 to K-206 to force all the gas to K-204, currently in manual at 0% (BPY-101).</p>

<p>- Collin with Mancal shut down his compressor at 7-36 early this afternoon, he will come back out later this evening to start it back up.</p>

<p><strong>- Cooler cleaners will be out tomorrow morning at around 6 or 7 AM to clean K-206 cooler bank.</strong></p>

<p>- Mark called and said if anything goes down on the 6-19 line to give him a call. (He is on call tonight.)</p>

<p>- 14-03 ESD shut in the field, notified operator Wazzy, he will come out this evening to reset.</p>

<p>- Shut in all sour production 5-14 WPNE, PNA, WPNA at 3:00PM due to PPM&#39;s climbing on process and sales, notified Kim with obsidian. All control valves are in manual at 0% and ESD&#39;s are closed.</p>

<p>- Devin replaced the flame sensing probe on the treater.</p>

<p>- Propane will be delivered tomorrow.</p>

<p>- Rob sucked out the sullair barrel and also sucked out the chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>- K-204 down on compressor oil temp at around 4:40PM, started it back up.</p>

<p>- Mark pigged the splitter, Jordi pulled the pig at the plant.</p>

<p>- Mark Stenberg took the A/C unit out of the amine MCC and cleaned it up, reinstalled and BOL.</p>

<p>- Added Nitrogen to V-200 barrier.</p>

<p>- Entered blowdowns and startups into envirosoft for the compressors going down yesterday.</p>

<p>- Increased the De-eth bottoms temp from 78 to 79 to try and reduce flaring off of the debutanizer.</p>
