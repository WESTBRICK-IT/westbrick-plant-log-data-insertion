========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-14 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized and cleaned control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Misc clean up throughout the plant.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth, K-204, K-201 and K-202 1st stg suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Added oil to K-203 speed governor.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine reboiler again 2x. Seeing abit of a hydrocarbon skim in the sight glass after blowing it down a few times. But skim line sight glass looks clean while skimming.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan to &quot;slow&quot; and turned off the single speed to raise accumulator pressure around 21:00. Slowly warmed up through the night and had to put single speed back on around 04:00.</p>

<p>Blew down TR-101 front and back water sight glasses. Front water quality was poor lastnight (forgot to mention in lastnights log) but it has cleaned up now.</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 top and bottom louver temp setpoint from 37 to 33 degrees to lower contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Opened up manual louvers on K-201 to cool down contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>May need to tighten the linkage for internal recycle louvers on K-201. The top JW louvers cycle but the recycles stay open and they should be operating together. Its running fairly warm so we should be fine during the upcoming cold. Hard to see in the dark.</p>

<p>Skimmed and drained amine skim tank.</p>

========================================
<p><strong><u>Weather: -11, snowy</u></strong></p>

<p>-Sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>-Nathan working on frequency converter for C3 compressor vibration sensors</p>

<p>-Devin working on flare meter calibrations, louvers, and comms issues with FQI-3008.&nbsp; comms working again</p>

<p>-pumped up wet leg on K-202 4th stage</p>

<p>-dumped k-204 scrubber</p>

<p>-dumped treater back water and blow down sight glass</p>

<p>-pigging dominion line from 5-21, pig pulled</p>

<p>-WPNE batch pigging, no pigs</p>

<p>-Hot oil pump seal leaking, switched pumps and will get seal repaired</p>

<p>-Lost hot oil heater while switching pumps, back online</p>

<p>-opened internal louvers on K-203 to help lower contactor inlet temps.&nbsp; Inlet temp is high from all the extra gas here due to compressor services at Braz North.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Pinched back 5-21 line a little bit due to high flow rate on sales at braz.&nbsp; only pinched back for 20 minutes or so then opened back up</p>

<p>-CMDS validations with Blaine over the phone</p>

<p>-Bob K and Jarrod site inspection&nbsp;</p>

<p>-HVO hauled in 1 load of oil from mancal</p>

<p>-shovelling snow multiple times today</p>

<p>-TIC-4300 amine reboiler temp control from 39.5% to 40% to increase heat from lower flow hot oil pump running</p>

<p>- Devin adjusted the south recycle louvers on K-201, found an actuator wasn&#39;t working properly so he dissasembled and replaced the diaphram and cleaned up the push rod as it had a bunch of corrosion on it.</p>
