========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+8 Degrees Cooling To -2 Degrees Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p><strong>Acid gas flare K/O pump was still not moving fluid. Pump not grabbing suction from thick, milky fluid. Let acid gas scrubbers dump clean fluid to K/O and sit for abit hoping it would help thin out the fluid that was in vessel. Kicked pump on hand again after sitting a couple hours and was able to get it to pump down. Started to pump faster and faster as the fluid became cleaner. Will monitor fluid quality and levels. Pump is back in auto and BOL.</strong></p>

<p>Slowed down debute overhead fan speed from 20% to 15% to raise debute pressure.</p>

<p>Raised K-203 top and bottom cooler temps from 33-35 degrees to warm up contactor inlet temp abit.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow tank to recycle out the trucked in fluid from earlier today. Slowed pump down from 80 to 70 m3/day.</p>

<p>Pembina kicked pumps on and density around 774.5 on our meter. Sped up recycle pump &quot;A&quot; from 100 m3/day to 125 m3/day to send more sales fluid through treater to bring the density up. Will monitor density and adjust as needed.</p>

<p>Reviewed last weeks E-log and emails.</p>
