<p><u><em><strong>+13 Degrees Cooling To -1 Degrees Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Added SAE 40 oil to K-203 speed governor.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st stg suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump barrier.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the production tank from the overflow tank due to low level.</p>

<p>East lubricator on the LPG pump plugged up. Cleared and dripping. Adjusted rate. May need to be adjusted later as needed.</p>

<p>Printed off LOTO, SVI, P&amp;ID and attached copy of accelerometer alarm timer bypass form for tomorrows shutdown and inspection on K-3301 &quot;B&quot; cyl#2 res gas cyliner/valves.</p>

<p>Printed off new copies of compressor log sheets for month end and filed old ones.</p>

<p>Lowered the level abit (approx 1&quot; in sight glass) in glycol seperator to help maintain glycol accumulator level.</p>

<p>V-104 gas flow boss (FQI-1104) flat lined. Powered down and reset comms. BOL and trending again.</p>

<p>V-3101 flow boss (FQI-3002) rings in on hi differential and clears shortly after. Supposed to ring in at 70 KPA. Looked through trends and 23 KPA diff was the highest it got to. <strong>WO#39065.</strong></p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;off&quot; to warm up amine contactor inlet.</p>

<p>HVO on site and offloaded 13-18 Mancal oil. <strong>Both recycles still in production tank.</strong></p>

<p>Sales pressure climbing steadily through the night. Called Trans Canada and they are aware of the pressure. All their machines are running they just have extra flow coming at them. May need to adjust co2 blending down the road if there is no change.</p>

<p>Slowed down the debute overheads cooler fan from 45% to 40%.</p>
