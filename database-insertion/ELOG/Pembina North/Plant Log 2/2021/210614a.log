========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+12 Degrees Warming to +28 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Turned the second bulk cooler fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot;.<strong> Will probably have to turn it to &quot;slow&quot; tonight.</strong></p>

<p>Worked on Q2 man down drill.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 33%. Left pump at 21%.</p>

<p>Water well tubing pressure running high, recycle valve is open due to pressure. Changed filters. Sampled some sludge and sent it in to Baker to see is we can batch somthing down the well to aid with the issues.</p>

<p>Core Labs out to take sweet monthly samples and weeklys.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-206. Put it in manual and slowed down to 800 RPM. Cut back suction pressure from 900 KPA to 740 KPA due to hi jacket water temp.</p>

<p>Sped up de bute fans to 100%.</p>

<p>Bob Koethler took surface water runoff samples to Element for us. Should have results tomorrow.</p>
