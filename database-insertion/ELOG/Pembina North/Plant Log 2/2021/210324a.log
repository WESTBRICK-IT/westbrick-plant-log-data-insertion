<p>- Topped up LPG packing lubricator.</p>

<p>- Pulled PNA and WPNE pigs.</p>

<p>- RPM out to suck a couple cubes of lube oil out of the waste lube oil tank 160.</p>

<p>- George K. out this afternoon to do some targeted inspections on safe work permits and for the Q4 Results presentation.</p>

<p>- Mark pigged the SW 8&quot; line to 5-21, lots of liquid slugs, <span style="color:#0000FF"><strong>still pulling linepack down at shift change, inlet control valve currently in &quot;Manual&quot; at 46%.</strong></span></p>

<p>- Slowed down the recycle pumps when fluids started slugging in, sped them back up at shift change.</p>

<p>- Al with HVO hauled in a load of Mancal emulsion, <strong><span style="color:#0000FF">valving is still currently in the &quot;Overflow&quot; tank, will need to switch over if Miktye is going to truck out tonight.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>- </strong>Lowered the amine make-up pump to 20% from 23% to try and maintain the level in the reboiler at 60%.</p>

<p>- Reviewed the procedure Blaine sent about flaring non-condensables from the C3 accumulator, made some changes and sent back to him.</p>

<p>- Drained the chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>- Adjusted regen tops temps while flows were down due to 5-21 pigging, back to original setpoint of 39.5% at shift change.</p>

<p>- Pembina called at 3:30PM, they shut us in on low density (.768) on our meter.</p>

<p>- Completed a WSI on Slips/Trips, submitted a workorder to have a permanent fan installed in the hot oil heater building rather than the temporary one. WO# 38921.</p>
