========================================
<p>weather: -5, some snow throughtout the day</p>

<p>-Nathan checked out recycle pump A overload issues, couldn&#39;t find issue, thought maybe heat with VFD, will check with Daren to look into PLC for more info on issues.&nbsp; Pump is currently down</p>

<p>-LPG pump lubricators slowed down a little bit</p>

<p>-Change out filters in west water filter pot.&nbsp; Fluid seemed questionable and there was a lot of &quot;mud&quot; looking stuff in the filters.&nbsp; They were right plugged.&nbsp; Chris took samples in to Baker Hughes to see what we can do</p>

<p>-talked to Baker Hughes about the sample from flare knock out.&nbsp; said condy settles fluid out.&nbsp; Tried getting Rob to pump a little condy in there.&nbsp; Got a little condy in, but still couldn&#39;t suck luid out of same line, some sort of blockage.&nbsp; Will try and get steamer lined up for tomorrow to heat vessel up and see if fluid can move.</p>

<p>-Booked grader for snow removal on keyera road, Zeta facility, and Pem North.&nbsp; Will probably be into the new year before they can show up</p>

<p>-Do 2 targeted inspections with Chris for safe work permits and MCHE</p>

<p>-Heard back from Baker Hughes on samples taken from water tank yesterday.&nbsp; Looks like normal fluid but when they let it settle out, there is a little condy on top, water underneath and the interface is a layer of that &quot;mud&quot;</p>

<ul>
	<li>talked to Kelly about water tank fluid, decided we will haul that fluid to disposal</li>
	<li>went over with Rob to try and empty some water out of those tank, but load valve wouldn&#39;t move, tried to heat valve up with hot waterm valve still wouldn&#39;t move.&nbsp; Will talk to supervisors about trying to find valve info to swap out for RIK.</li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">Talked to Mancal operator and told them they won&#39;t be able to truck in any more water to use until further notice.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>-Heater not working in tool crib, Nathan looked at it and couldn&#39;t fix it tonight, will try and get it fixed tomorrow.</p>

<p>-Hi-flo out proving keylink meter</p>

<p>-Carl with driven dropped off some supplies</p>

<p>-snugged up east packing on west amine pump a little.</p>

<p>-amine pump packing drain line plugged, hooked up to air and blew it out.&nbsp; Fine now.</p>
