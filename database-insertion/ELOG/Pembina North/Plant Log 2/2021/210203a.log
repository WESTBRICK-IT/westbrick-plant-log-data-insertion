========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-23 &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Got K-202 fired up at shift change.</p>

<p>Brought on LP inlets.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suct scrubber and K-202 3rd stg scrubber.</p>

<p>Increased K-203 top and bottom cooler temps to 37 degrees from 34 degrees to warm up amine contactor.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers and tarp a little on the South side of amine trim cooler.</p>

<p>Manually dumped V-104 sep and blocked dump line back in after.</p>

<p>Got amine reboiler level to the skim line at the end of the night. Skimmed and didnt see any hydrocarbon through the sight glass. Blew down the sight glass and amine looks clean and dont see any skim of hydrocarbon. Will let settle out and try again later.</p>

<p>Lowered the amine makeup pump from 30 to 20.</p>

<p>Adjusted lickage on the res gas louvers to get them to cloase more to maintain contactor inlet temp better.</p>

<p><strong>May need to get K-203 louvers adjusted with the cold weather coming and see if we can get K-204s louvers to close abit tighter.</strong></p>
