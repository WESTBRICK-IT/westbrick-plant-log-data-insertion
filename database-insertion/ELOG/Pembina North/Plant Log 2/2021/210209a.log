========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-24 Degrees Cooling To -38 Degrees Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized and cleaned control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Dropped the night shift truck off at OK Tire and picked up the spare Ford. Shift truck had an engine light and the starter kept disengaging while turning over. Once truck is done OK tire will call control room. We are supossed to notify Kelly and he will arrange for the truck to be dropped off at the Keyera office.</p>

<p>HVO here at shift change to offload Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters.</p>

<p>11-22 well back on after steamer thawed short section of line at annex earlier today. V-207 will not dump. Pumped methanol downstream of dump control valve back to the seperator. All clear. Will need a to pump methanol from annex to the battery.</p>

<p>Adjusted amine reboiler temp control valve as needed.</p>

<p>Shut of the VFD fan on the amine bulk cooler. May need it back on today.</p>

<p>Pembina down on density. Assuming yesterdays pig was the culprit. BS&amp;W ringing in and out also. Both pumps sped up to 130 m3/day. Verified that the PAO 1001 chemical pump was pumping.</p>

<p>Cut back amine makeup pump from 21 to 20 as the reboiler level was climbing fairly steadly.</p>

<p>Hot oil flow still low around 210 m3/day. Has got a little better after part of the box was installed.</p>

<p>Changed out the sales analyzer tape.</p>

<p>Sanitized spare Ford truck for hand off with Kevin.</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS validations with Blain over the phone.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water.</p>

<p>Lowered level slightly in the glycol seperator to help with returns.</p>
