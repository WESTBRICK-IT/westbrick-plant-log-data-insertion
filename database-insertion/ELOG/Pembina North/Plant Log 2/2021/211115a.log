========================================
<p>Weather: -2 and cloudy</p>

<p>-hot gas bypass and C3 suction control back in auto</p>

<p>-Amine make-up water pump from 9 to 7.5.&nbsp; I can check concentration tonight and adjust again if needed</p>

<p>-drain de-eth suction scrubber</p>

<p>-volcano boiler temp increased from 73 to 76 degrees</p>

<p>-fill LPG lubricator pot</p>

<p>-Chiller level back to 13.5%</p>

<p>-De-bute tower low level several times throughout the night, set level from 45 to 50, been fine since.&nbsp; I will try and think of what to do for reflux, maybe valves can be tuned to react faster.</p>

<p>-de-bute fans from 25 to 20%</p>

<p><!--StartFragment--><u><em><strong>-3&deg;C throughout the day, heavy snowfall</strong></em></u><!--EndFragment--></p>

<p>- Shut down K-202 first thing this morning for maintenance, shut in V-200 as well to prevent LP from flaring.</p>

<p>- APECS on site to service K-202 engine and compressor.</p>

<p>- Louvretech repaired the louvers on K-202.</p>

<p>- Flint working on pipefitting in the new starter for K-202, currently still here at shift change.</p>

<p>- Devin repaired V-104 inlet control valve due to the trim passing, on V-104 page the back pressure controller has two faceplates that open up, <u><strong>currently the LP header pressure override for V-104 is in manual at 100%</strong></u>, this valve normally runs in auto, but due to K-202 being down the LP pressure is too high and this valve for V-104 closes, V-104 is currently in MP mode and thus the LP header pressure override is not needed but it will still close in the V-104 back pressure valve.</p>

<p>- <u><strong><span style="background-color:#FFFF00">K-202 3rd stage scrubber is currently 71% level, increased the dump setpoints so the level control valve closes. Setpoints are normally at 30% start, 20% stop.&nbsp; Currently at 75% start.</span></strong></u></p>

<p>- Shut down K-5000 for an oil change and cooler fan inspection.</p>

<p>- Devin is installing new tubing lines for K-202 starter at shift change.</p>

<p>- Adjusted amine reboiler temps through the day while gas flows were down, back at 35% at shift change.</p>

<p>- <strong>Mark S. will be replacing the manual block valve on the WPNE pipeline on Thursday.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Once K-202 is back in service please contact Kim with Obsidian.</strong></p>

<p>- Leo pumped out the underground compressor oil drain tank.</p>

<p>- Increased the volcano outlet temp to 80&deg;C from 76&deg;C.</p>

<p>- Leo cleaned up soaker pads around K-202 and K-201,</p>

<p>- Blew down the treater front water sightglass.</p>
