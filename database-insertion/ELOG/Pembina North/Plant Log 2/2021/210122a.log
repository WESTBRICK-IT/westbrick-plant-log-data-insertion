========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-5 Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Rob T hauled in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>HVO brought in 2 loads on Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Changed filters at water plant. Jiffy clamp looks good.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-203 scrubber.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-201 compressor to increase amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Pumped up the downhole ESD at the acid gas well.</p>

<p>Working on targeted inspections for Pem North and Braz North Winter Rediness. Romeo also has a look around Braz facility reguarding list expectations. Nightshift, can review the list if you like before we forward it off.</p>

<p>Started to review Maximo work orders to determine which ones can be signed off. Will work on the more through the weekend.</p>

<p>14-03 pig sent at 09:40. Started to slug around 1:15 continuously until 16:50. Lots of fluid. Pulling down line pack still at shift change. Will pull pig tomorrow.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps still in the shipping tank. Did not bother to recycle out the 2 loads of trucked in fluid from the overflow tank until we determine where we sit with density from the 14-03 pig. Will swing into the overflow tomorrow once Pembina pumps us down.</p>

<p>Misread the mileage on the spare admin truck and it isnt due for an oil change yet. Cancelled the appt that was mentioned in yesterdays elog.</p>
