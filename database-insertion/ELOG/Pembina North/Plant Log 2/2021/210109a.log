<p><u><strong>-2<!--StartFragment-->&deg;<!--EndFragment-->C, calm and sunny</strong></u></p>

<p>- Pumped out amine packing drain tank, drained the amine skim tank to the underground.</p>

<p>- Worked on weekend checks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Checked SCBA&#39;s and supplied air bottle pressures, as well as work packs.</li>
	<li>Did PH tests on lean amine and lean glycol.</li>
	<li>Checked expiry dates on eye wash stations.</li>
	<li>Started backup generator and ran it for 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>- Pembina pumped us down throughout the day, no issues.</p>

<p>- Lean glycol concentration is at 77.8%, rich is at 72%.</p>

<p>- Swung one recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow tank, lowered the rate from 115m<sup>3</sup>/day to 100m<sup>3</sup>/day.</p>

<p>- H2O plant to well balance was out today, seems to go out whenever Rob is not hauling, only one booster pump has been running, started the second one to see if it makes a difference in the books tomorrow.</p>

<p>- Worked on CMDS.</p>

<p>- Sanitized control room at start and end of shift.</p>
