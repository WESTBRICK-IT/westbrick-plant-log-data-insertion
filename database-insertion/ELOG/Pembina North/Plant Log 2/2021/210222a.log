========================================
<p><strong>Weather: +6 to -2 in morning.&nbsp; Mostly clear.&nbsp; Small amount of snow</strong></p>

<p>-sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>-Issues with flow rate at our rat creek station, talked to Kristina about dropping CO2 blending</p>

<p>-K-104 issues at Braz North.&nbsp; Communication with Ridgeback operator about compressor issues and estimated time of repair</p>

<p><strong>-Lowered 7-11 CO2 blending from 290 to 270 e3m3.&nbsp; Thank you to Kristina and Jessica for getting noms changed</strong></p>

<p><strong>-High pressure on sales line.&nbsp; Called TCPL, they are aware of the line pack issues and are working on resolving them.</strong></p>

<p>-Slowed down K-203 due to high discharge pressure alarm ringing in</p>

<p><strong>-Pembina density at 775 while pumping, waited for them to be done shipping oil, then put recycle pump B in the overflow tank.&nbsp; Slowed rate down to 75m3/day</strong></p>

<p>-Shut of 2 speed C3 condenser fan due to colder temps</p>

<p><strong>-Adjusted chiller level from 11.5% to 11% as we started moving less gas after K-104 repair</strong></p>

<p>-Sped up K-203 after K-104 repair</p>

<p><u><em><strong>-2 Degrees Warming to +5 Degrees Clear &amp; Gusty Winds</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control AM and PM.</p>

<p>Dumped de eth suction scrubber and K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan on slow while the single speed condencer fan was running to lower accumulator pressure and amine contactor inlet gas temp.</p>

<p>Mark pigged WPNE. Pulled.</p>

<p>Worked on targeted inspections for MCHE LOTO, SVI and Covid-19.</p>

<p>Prepped for K-206 shutdown tomorrow AM. Prepped LOTO, hauled oil, SVI, ensured crews were coming. Producers have been notified Friday.</p>

<p>Worked on V-3101 pigging procedure. <strong>Op&#39;s please review and sign off on table. Once completed please scan to Blaine H to be input into OE folder.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ordered process water for Wednesday @ approx 11 AM. Braz River has been notified.</strong></p>

<p>Core Labs out to take weekly samples. They also grabbed a sample of sales oil from Pembina line to test for vapour pressure.</p>

<p>BV Labs out to take LPG sample from auto sampler. Auto sampler has been put back into &quot;auto&quot;.</p>

<p>RCO grator out to scratch plant road intersection, plant enterance and main loop.</p>

<p>Kyle guided &quot;Affordable Lock &amp; Key&quot; Locksmith from Tidewater enternace to Zeta Creek plant.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Mancal oil. (13-34-49-12). Mass flow ticket read good.</p>
