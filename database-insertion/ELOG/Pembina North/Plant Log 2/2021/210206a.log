========================================
<p><u><em><strong>Cooling To -26 Degrees, Calm &amp; Light Snow</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized and cleaned control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Cut back amine reboiler temp control valve from 40% to 39.5% to lower the regen tops temp slightly.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber and K-202 1st stg suct scrubber.</p>

<p>Pinched the manual louvers on K-201 compressor to warm up amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Raised K-201 top and bottom cooler temp from 33 degrees to 35 degrees to warm up amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Raised K-203 top and bottom cooler temp from 35 to 37 degrees to warm up amine contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>K-203 top and bottom louver controls were swinging. Put in manual and lined it out then back in auto and it maintained fine.</p>

<p>Raised res gas cooler temp setpoint from 31 degrees to 32 degrees to prevent it from opening prematurely.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Turned on some heaters in compression and V-107 building.</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS validations with Romeo.</p>

<p>Lowered the chiller level from 10% to 9% to maintain the recommended 3 to 5 degree tempature differential.</p>

<p>Amine reboiler/regen tops temp and reflux rate is behaving better. It seems that after cycling the reboiler temp control valve after swapping pumps, skimming and lowering makeup rate may have helped.</p>

<p><u><strong>-23&deg;C today, light snowfall.</strong></u></p>

<p>- Tarped in the bottom half of K-204, top cooler exit temp got down to 5&deg;C, temperature came up to 14&deg;C throughout the day.</p>

<p>- Added C3 to the accumulator, 3 bolts to 10 bolts. 40% to 20% in the North storage tank.</p>

<p>- Rob out hauling zeta water and sucked out the emmisions tank at braz.</p>

<p>- K-202 2nd stage valves had quite a bit of differential from inboard to outboard, had Tyson come out and replace bad outboard discharge valves.</p>

<p>- Notified Wade with Obsidian and Bob with Torc that we had to shutdown the compressor, notified them when it was back online.</p>

<p>- Grader came out and plowed the main roadway into the plant.</p>

<p>- Pumped up the ESD&#39;s at the acid gas well.</p>

<p>- Shut down the debut overheads cooler AC-3102B due to ambient temps.</p>

<p>- Mark will be pigging the Southwest 8&quot; line tomorrow.</p>

<p>- Pinched the amine reboiler hot oil valve from 39.5% to 39% while V-200 was shut in and flows were down to try and maintain 98&deg;C on the regen tops.</p>

<p>- Changed water plant filters (East Pot) West pot is now in service.</p>

<p>- Started weekend checks, bubble tested casing vents at 3-27, 14-22 and 6-22.</p>

<p>- Checked chemical rates in the battery and up at process.</p>

<p>- HVO called, they will be hauling a load of Mancal 4-7 Emulsion in tomorrow.</p>

<p>- Topped up glycol accumulator.</p>
