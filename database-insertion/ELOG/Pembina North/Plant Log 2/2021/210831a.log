<p><u><em><strong>Weather: Cloudy and raining through the day, 9&deg;C this morning, 10&deg;C this afternoon.</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Tuesday morning maintenance meeting.</p>

<p>Production tank level transmitter went faulty and the level dropped off, equalized the tanks for a bit because we couldn&#39;t see the level in the production tank, had Devin repair it, had to make some changes to the production books manually, notified Kristina.</p>

<p>Devin looked at the process H2S analyzer, found some liquids in the sample line which was causing it to read inaccurately, <strong>blew down horizontal coalescer to ensure no liquids were getting carried over, nightshift could you please do this as well, thank you!!! </strong></p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivered 8m<sup>3</sup> of R.O water.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the De-Eth O/H suction scrubber.</p>

<p><strong>GGT and Hi-Flo will be out on Friday to prove the truck-in meter.</strong></p>
