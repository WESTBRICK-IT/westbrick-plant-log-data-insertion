========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-24 Cooling To -37 Degrees Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber, K-202 1st stg and K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Adjusted the amine regen tops temp as needed as the gas flows were up and down.</p>

<p>5-23 Clearview down again around 7:30 PM and back up again around 9:30 PM. Talked to him earlier and he said he was having hydrate issues in his compressor cooler bank.</p>

<p>Hot oil flow still reading inaccurate, averaging around 200 m3/day. All reboilers operating normally and hot oil system peramiters are normal. Just the flow thats off.</p>

<p>Lit the heater in the ambulance shack. Welding shop and warehouse ran all night.</p>

<p>Misc cleanup around plant.</p>

<p>Assisted Romeo with Zeta h2s analyzer issues.</p>

<p>Thanks Devin and dayshift for your efforts yesterday in the cold.</p>

<p><u><strong>-37&deg;C this morning, warmed up to -24&deg;C this afternoon</strong></u></p>

<p>- Mark pigged the Southwest 8&quot; to 5-21, Pig sent at 7:45AM, Liquids came at 11:00AM, slugged in for 4 hours, <span style="color:#FF0000">still pulling linepack down at shift change, inlet control left in &quot;Manual&quot; at 60%.</span></p>

<p>- Shut down K-201 early this morning when the flows were down, started back up this afternoon when the flows came back up after the pig reached 5-21.</p>

<p>- Lowered the amine reboiler hot oil control to 39% from 39.5% due to the Regen tops temp climbing with the lack of flows, back up to 39.5% at shift change.</p>

<p>- Initiated an MOC for the insulating box to be installed on FT-H400.</p>

<p>- Polard out today building an insulation box around FT-H400 hot oil flow transmitter, they will be out tomorrow to install another little cover on the flow meter.</p>

<p>- Worked on AER inspection pre-cleanup list.</p>

<p>- Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>- Everett with Obsidian brought out a steamer to thaw out the pipeline going into the annex from the 11-22 Obsidian well.</p>

<p>- HVO hauled in a load of 4-7 mancal emulsion at shift change.</p>

<p>- Kristina hung new meter tags out in the plant.</p>

<p>- Daren worked on K-205 louver control.</p>

<p>- Snugged up some wall vents in the LPG building to try and warm it up a bit.</p>
