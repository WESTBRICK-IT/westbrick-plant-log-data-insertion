========================================
<p>Weather: -6. snowy and windy</p>

<p>-<span style="color:#0000FF">Dayshift: please watch footing, it snowed all night with wind so there is potentially slippery conditions</span></p>

<p>-K-202 work going on at shift change, extended permits.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Devin finished tying in tubing lines for new starter</li>
	<li>issues on startup with a cracked fitting on SRV that was brought from braz compressors, Tyler found new one and replaced.</li>
	<li>Issues with engine oil pump when attempting startup again, had to remove pump and fix, back together</li>
	<li>haul oil down to K-202 to finish filling up engine and compressor oil, took partial drum back up to oil dock</li>
	<li>compressor fired up around10:30, knocked down 1 time due to scrubber level.&nbsp; Cold gas on start up caused a lot of condensing.&nbsp; Drained scrubbers a few times and has been fine since.&nbsp; pumped up wet leg on 3rd stage scrubber level transmitter.&nbsp; 3rd stage dump back to 30% start, 20% stop</li>
</ul>

<p>-V-104 LP override control back in auto</p>

<p>-Add some glycol to accumulator early in night, low level, not getting returns with low flows from K-202 down.&nbsp; Glycol came back after K-202 started moving gas</p>

<p>-Communicate with Kim with obsidian when we started pulling V-200 line down again, he fired up his wells</p>

<p>-Amine regen tops temp getting low with extra flows, increased TIC-4300 from 35 to 35.5%</p>

<p>-3-37 casing pressure rang in high, went to water well to make sure heater was on and it was good.&nbsp; Bled a little pressure off transmitter then opened again to make sure there was no blockage.&nbsp; Seems to be fine.&nbsp; Looks like pressure always increased, then drops once water plant fires up.</p>

<p>-V-200 valves back in auto once line pack has been pulled down</p>

<p>-C3 condenser single speed fan turned off, 2 speed turned on slow</p>
