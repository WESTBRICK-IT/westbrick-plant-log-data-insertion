========================================
<p><u><em><strong>Weather: -14&deg;C this morning =&gt; -4&deg;C this afternoon, clear and calm.</strong></em></u></p>

<p>- Blew down horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>- Rob was out hauling Zeta produced water.</p>

<p>- G&amp;C steamers hauling Mancal produced water, they will be hauling 3 or 4 more loads tonight.</p>

<p>- Nathan replaced a smoke detector in the maintenance office.</p>

<p>- Acid gas knockout pump (P-3502B) was not pumping, had Tyler K. take a look at it, it has the same thick milky fluid in it as it did the last time this caused issues, disconnected the suction line and blew it down a little into a pail, we were able to get the level down from 50% to 24% before it stopped pumping again. Will try and let it build a level again and see if it grabs suction, <u><strong>hand switch is currently &quot;OFF&quot; so it doesn&#39;t damage the pump.</strong></u></p>

<p>- Worked on ADR.</p>

<p>- Chris C. and Devin worked on the V-107 coreolis, Chris said he will need to stop by again tomorrow to finish working on it.</p>

<p>- Plant Steady.</p>
