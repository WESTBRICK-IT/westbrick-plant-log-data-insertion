<p>Wolf creek pig still slugging in at the end of the shift.</p>

<p>Sped up De Bute fan.</p>

<p>Dropped K-203 and K201 cooler set points 2 degrees each.&nbsp; K-203 36 from 38 de grees, and K-201 34 from 36 degrees.</p>

<p>Pinched Amine reboiler valve 0.5% due to warmer top temps.</p>

<p>Blew down K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Put a recycle in the Overflow tank to get the water out so we have more room to equalize.</p>

<p>K-104 down at Braz due to a water pump failure.&nbsp; Increased flow here 80 e3m3.</p>

<p>Tyson did a walk through.</p>

<p>Checked Thief hatch for built up pressure on the Production tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasn&#39;t much there.</p>

<p>Notified HVO to hold off hauling to us for now.</p>
