========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-5 Degrees Warming To +16 Degrees, Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of R/O water from Nelson Bros.</p>

<p>Gas Track fugitive emissions guy was out scoping out packing vents with Chris Platt.</p>

<p>Vermilion Pigged and batched to V-103 from the Ranch Road. Pig slugged from 09:30 AM till 3:30 PM and made 66 m3 of liquids in that time.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; to cool down contactor inlet and lower surge tank pressure.</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 top and bottom louver setpoints from 35 degrees to 33 degrees and K-201 from 33 degrees to 32 degrees to cool down contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Mark pigged the Splitter from 7-11 to Braz and 7-11 to Pem.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Obsidian and Zeta water.</p>

<p>Keabray will be out tomorrow to take the big green containment to Dayton Mohr for a project. Should be back soon.</p>

<p>Lowered the bulk cooler fan setpoint from 30 degrees to 29 degrees to take abit of load off the chiller.</p>

<p>V-103 flow boss froze. Pulled power and comms and reset it. BOL and trending.</p>

<p>Had to cut back amine reboiler temp control valve while flows were down. Put it back to 38.5% once flow are back and in <u><em><strong>manual.</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Turned the amine makeup pump rate from 17% to 18.5% as level in reboiler is trending down fairly steady.</p>

<p>Raised debute fan from 30% to 45% to lower debute pressure.</p>

<p>Raised chiller level from 12.5% to 13% to maintain 3-5 degree temp differential.</p>

<p>Cracked the West window in the instrument air building to cool it down abit durning the day. May need to close later.</p>
