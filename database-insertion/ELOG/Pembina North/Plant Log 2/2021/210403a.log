========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+8 Degrees Cooling to -3 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Tightened North packing on North EG injection pump.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute cooler fan to 35%.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; and turned the single speed fan off to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Bumped up K-203 top and bottom cooler temp by 1 degree to help maintain contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Pembina called around 18:30 PM to let us know we are down on density. We were between 774-775 on our meter and 785 on Pembinas meter earlier that day. After 14-03 pig our meter showed 768 and Pembinas 778. Our daily noms were 10m3 away from being met anyways. Equalized tanks, sped up recycle pump &quot;A&quot; from 100 m3 to 130 m3 out of the production tank while its filling with fresh production and slowed down recycle pump &quot;B&quot; from 100 m3 to 65 m3 out of the overflow and slowly recycling the light stuff back through again. May need to call Pembina to try again. Noms reset at 7AM.</p>

<p>Reviewed and signed off on some procedures on the table.</p>

<p>Looked over c3 &quot;B&quot; compressor in detail. Valves, jack skrewes etc all good. Sounds fine.</p>
