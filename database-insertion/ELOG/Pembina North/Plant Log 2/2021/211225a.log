<p>Weather: -29, overcast</p>

<p>-Tyson and Nathan on site to pull P-2 volcano glycol circulating pump motor.&nbsp; No spare motors so Nathan took motor home and will take it in to be fix next week.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">Please watch out for A-Frame hoist in boiler building&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>-amine reboiler temp controller TIC-4300</p>

<p>-shut off debute 3102A fan as debute pressure was low</p>

<p>-sales gas temp off K-205 was cold.&nbsp; threw a tarp on the cooler and gas warmed up a few degrees</p>

<p>-Rob hauling in Zeta creek condy</p>

<p>-FQI-3006 sales gas flow rate was bouncing up and down a lot, blew down meter and it came back normal</p>

<p>-FQI-8 boot gas rang in a few times on low temperature.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if there is too much to do to help it.&nbsp; I slowed down recycle pump B hoping less fluid would add retention time in treater to warm up liquids to boot, but pump went down, started up and flow was adjusted from 85 to 80.</p>

<p>-work order to replace battery on skid steer.&nbsp; SR 6047895</p>

<p>-H-400 hot oil heater temps were quite low earlier this morning.&nbsp; Dropped from the usual 200 inlet/ 210 outlet to 170 inlet/ 180 outlet.&nbsp; Kyle suggested screens on air intake plugged checked them out and they did look dirty, pulled screens out a bit to get good air flow, no concerns now with no dust and no tree fluff, will cut new screens tomorrow.&nbsp; Temps levelled out for a few hours and then came back to normal. Thanks kyle</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boiler ran fine for about 5 hours, then went down on flame failure.&nbsp; Talked to Devin about issues.&nbsp; And suggested cleaning fire eye, pulled fire eye and it was clean</li>
	<li>heater had a hard time starting but Kyle showed up from Zeta to assist us, Thank you Kyle</li>
	<li>Talked to Shawn Ditner about issues with the air preheater, he was going to check online for P&amp;ID&#39;s of boiler to understand that preheater, will come out and have better understanding of heater if heater goes down, heater is running now</li>
</ul>

<p>-v-200 was shut in when boiler went down to prevent going sour, still having line pack and bleeding down at shift change.&nbsp; Nightshift:&nbsp; please bleed line down tonight.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
