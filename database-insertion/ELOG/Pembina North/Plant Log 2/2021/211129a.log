<p>- Shut in 1-21 Obsidian line first thing this morning to build pressure, Mark S. on site to assist with pigging the line inside the plant.</p>

<p>- Mark also pigged the WPNE pipeline, pig is pulled and was clean.</p>

<p>- Jordan with Baker Hughes out to deliver some SRW-6990 (Iron Chelator) to add to the water tank for the Mancal produced water being trucked in, also grabbed produced water samples.</p>

<p>- Devin worked on K-201 compressor oil kenco, he was unable to repair, he will go to 16-35 tomorrow morning and grab a replacement kenco.</p>

<p><strong>- Dustin with Flint will have a crew out on Wednesday this week to install the new piping for the glycol o/h tank loadline.</strong></p>

<p>- Tyson T. out to grab compressor oil samples, we also looked at the C3 compressor and are trying to figure out the glycol loop foaming issues, loosened off the breather cap on the expansion tank as to see if it will help, used a gas monitor to see if there was any LEL coming off of the expansion tank, had no LEL readings, we will continue to monitor and notify Tyson.</p>

<p>- Jordi got the LPG pump packing lube rates back to 15 drips/minute, also blew out the tubing lines.</p>
