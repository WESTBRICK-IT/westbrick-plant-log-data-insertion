<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Al with HVO hauled in the 13-18 Mancal load around 20:30 PM. Volume, cuts and density seem to be accurate.</p>

<p>Added nitrgoen to V-200 pump.</p>

<p>Recycling out of both production and overflow tank through the night. Pembina pumped 95 m3 through the night and density was around 780.</p>

<p>-sanitize start and end of shift</p>

<p>-field ops sent sw 8&quot; pig this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Morning meeting.&nbsp;<span style="color:#FF0000">Field ops mentioned an outage at 15-7 next tuesday (Jan 12)&nbsp;for a riser install.&nbsp; Flows will be down for some time</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-WO 38219&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#000000">submitted for troubleshooting 4-7 well issues in truck offload meter</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-working on training guide</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-working on CMDS</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-Devin calibrating flare meters</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-Pembina getting samples</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-Field ops sent WPNE pig to see if we can bump first pig in.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000">-2 orientations for cathodic solutions to pull corrosion coupon on V-200 inlet</span></p>

<p><font color="#000000">-</font><span style="color:#FF0000">LEL and H2S bypassed for v-200 corrosion coupon pull.&nbsp; Bypassed at 13:15, bypass off at 13:44</span></p>

<p>-PPL dropped our density to 785kg/m3.&nbsp; 785 is where we have been running for density lately.&nbsp; the 775 density that we see on the DCS is not temperature corrected.&nbsp; PPL put in work order so that they can make changes to allow us to see the temperature corrected density on the DCS.</p>

<p>-slowed down K-203 to see if it will help with valve temps.&nbsp; Slowed down to 790 rpm, made a minor difference of 4 degrees, but temp differentials&nbsp;are still way out</p>

<p>-Devin and Kristina looked at truck in meter issues.&nbsp; Seems like its only an issue with 4-7 well and the issue&nbsp;is potentially due to a spartan upgrade in november.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>-drain de-oiler</p>

<p>-drain inlet coalescer, clean</p>

<p>-sped K-203 back up to 850 rpm</p>

<p>-MOC has been entered by for looking into issues and potential fixes for the valve temp spread on K-203</p>
