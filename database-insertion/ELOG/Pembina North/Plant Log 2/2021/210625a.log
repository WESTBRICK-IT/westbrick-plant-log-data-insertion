========================================
<p><u><em><strong>+25 Degrees Cooling To +15 Degrees, Calm &amp; Clear</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber and K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Little oil.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Treater tripping out on flame fail when kicking on hi fire. Pinched the main fuel gas and slowly opened as the flame was blowing the pilot away from the flame sensor.</p>

<p>Shutdown the water plant for abit and got the tubing to pull a vacuum of -78 kpa. Kicked boosters on and the tubing pressured up within 5 mins to 570 kpa and only flowing around 19 m3.</p>

<p>Cut back debute cooler fan speed by 10%.</p>

<p><u><em><strong>*This log is for June 24, 2021*</strong></em></u></p>

<p><strong>14&deg;C this morning, warming up to 25&deg;C this afternoon, clear and calm</strong></p>

<p>Sanitized the control room am and pm</p>

<p>Devin and Flint crew replaced the water disposal pump bypass valve.</p>

<p>With the bypass valve repaired on the water disposal pump the pump now is discharging full volumes and the disposal well pressures up within minutes. Daren increased the disposal pump start height to 16 feet so the booster pumps will run longer. The booster pumps are only pumping at a rate of 12 m3 a day at 560 kpa pressue. Called Raymond and he says if needed to truck Zeta water to Travita for the time being.</p>

<p>Dumped k204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Devin replaced the trim on k-202 4th stage scrubber dump valve.</p>

<p>Dumped k-202 2nd stage scrubber</p>

<p>Swapped the c3 2 speed fan from slow to fast.</p>

<p>Increased the debute fan speed to 50% from 35</p>

<p>Mark Spelrem hooked a chart recorder on the acid gas casing pressure.</p>

<p>BV Labs out to take NGL sample</p>

<p>Mancal pigged, high leveled V-101 several times</p>

========================================
<p>Start of shift clear and 16 degrees warming up to 32 in the afternoon, little breeze.</p>

<p>Swung the 2 speed bulk cooler fan to fast.</p>

<p>Increased the debute cooler fan speed to 50% from 35%</p>

<p>Mark finished the pack test on the acid gas well and the water well. He had Kpa pressure the acid gas casing up to 8700 kpa</p>

<p>Slowed down K-206 to 810 from 900 rpm and lowered the suction pressure set point from 900 to 760kpa</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204 from 870 to 800 rpm</p>

<p>Slowed down K-202 from 900 to 850 rpm</p>

<p>Slowed down K-205 from 865 to 850 rpm</p>

<p>Pumped up the level colume wet leg on K-204 dump</p>

<p>Lowered the amine regen tops temp by 1% on the control output.</p>
