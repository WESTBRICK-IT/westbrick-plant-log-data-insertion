========================================
<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Turned off the single speed condencer fan and turned the 2 speed fan on &quot;slow&quot; to raise the contactor inlet temp and the c3 accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Pembina shipped through the night. 779 avg density.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suct scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st stg scrubber.</p>

<p>Raised K-203 top and bottom cooler temp setpoint 1 degree.</p>

<p>Checked LPG packing lubricators. All good.</p>

<p>Slowed down recycle pump &quot;B&quot; from 150 m3 to 115 m3 out of the overflow to ensure we were well within our density for the upcoming pig.</p>

<p>CMDS.</p>

<p><strong><u><!--StartFragment-->-5&deg;<!--EndFragment-->C, Sunny and calm.</u></strong></p>

<p>-Manually dumped de-eth overheads suction scrubber</p>

<p>-Manually dumped K-203 suction scrubber</p>

<p>-Mark S. sent the 14-03 Wolf creek pig at 8:30AM, started taking on liquids at 1:10PM, slugged in for roughly 3 1/2 hours, slowed down recycle pumps while V-3101 was dumping hard.</p>

<p>-Cliff Ellis with Clearview called at 10:35AM about increase in pressures, notified Mark S. he went out to check the 7-7 ESD, found no issues, ended up being an ESD on Clearview&#39;s end that was 3/4&#39;s closed.</p>

<p>-Clearview 5-23 Pressure trend wasn&#39;t working on the DCS, notified Daren, he fixed it and it is now working properly.</p>

<p>-Nelson Bros delivered RO water.</p>

<p>-Shut off the 2 speed C3 condenser fan and turned on the single speed.</p>

<p>-Pembina called at 12:20PM notifiying us that they shut down on low density, put both recycle pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>-Called Pembina again at 3:00PM to start pumping, went down on low density once again.</p>

<p>-Dillon with PPL out to adjust our low density shudown from .790 to .785, started back up and they are still pumping at shift change.</p>

<p>-Nathan out replacing lights throughout the plant.</p>

<p>-Adjusted the lube rates on the LPG pump, increased them.</p>

<p>-Chris N serviced the skid steer.</p>

<p>-Allan B out to work on the welding list, did some modifications to the LPG surface water release ditch walkway, also made some mesh covers for the out of service tanks in the battery.</p>

<p>-Did an amine concentration, 38%, increased the makeup pump from 19 to 21.</p>

<p>-Added glycol to the C3B expansion tank.</p>
