<p>-drain de-eth suction scrubber</p>

<p>-C3 condenser single speed fan off and 2 speed fan on slow</p>

<p>-Warming up the plant a little to make less LPG&#39;s.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#0000FF">Pinched C3 suction control valve from manual 86 to manual 43%.&nbsp; This didn&#39;t seem to make a big difference in temp to made additional changes</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#0000FF">LIC-3121 chiller fill valve lowered from 13.5 to 9.5%</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#0000FF">Hot gas bypass setpoint changed from 43 to 88 kpa.&nbsp; these changes helped warm up plant</span></li>
</ul>

<p>-Debute fans changed from 30% to 0%</p>

<p>-glycol level was dropping to 58%.&nbsp; added a small amount of glycol quickly and then stopped to see if we were hanging up in still column.&nbsp; Level came back up to 80% by shift change</p>

<p>-With the C3 changes tonight the surge tank level has come up.&nbsp; I checked it at 4 and level was at 9.5 bolts.&nbsp; will need to monitor and pump C3 back to storage if it gets too high.</p>
