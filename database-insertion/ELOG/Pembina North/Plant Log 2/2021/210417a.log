========================================
<p><u><em><strong>-2 Degrees Warming to +20 Degrees, Clear &amp; Calm</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Skimmed and drained amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend and monthly checks.</p>

<p>Left both pumps recycling out of the shipping tank all day due to vapour pressure issues. Assuiming we will have to equalize again tonight.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan to fast to cool down contactor inlet temp and lower accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Cut back amine reboiler temp controller from 38% to 37.5% to lower regen tops temp and reflux rate abit. May need to adjust later when gas flows come back up. <u><em><strong>Valve in manual.</strong></em></u></p>

<p>Opened up South East trim cooler louvers 1 notch due to warm ambiant temps.</p>

<p>Adjusted chiller level control as needed to maintain temp diff.</p>

<p>Amine concentration at 34.5%, bumped up amine makeup pump from 21-22 to build a little more reboiler level and get it closer to the skim line.</p>

<p>Pumped up the downhole ESD at the acid gas well.</p>
