========================================
<p>drained K203 suction scrubber</p>

<p>Production tank at 3.14 at 19:00, checked</p>

<p>6-19 pressure comming down at the ESD, found pressure drop across the pig trap. Bypassed the pig trap and poured some hot H2O on the inlet valve area. Still ecess pressure drop across the pipeline and inlet valves</p>

<p>no security issues at Braz</p>

========================================
<p>Morning meeting, weather -20</p>

<p>Fusion out to do meter calibrations.</p>

<p>Core Labs was out doing weeklys</p>

<p>Work notification to see H2S meter on the TCPL on the DCS. SR #- 6069135</p>

<p>RPM pressure truck came in for the 9-16 Vermillion line from restriction which we got flowing for a few hours and 3101 high leveled from the trapped fluids when it started flowing again. Flow eventually restricted again so we injected methanol at 3 diffirent points U/S and D/S of the flow valve. Flow eventually freed up again.</p>

<p>The liquid rate off the V-3101 dump line started to drop off so we injected methanol to the Y screen on the dump line. We left the methanol valve line up going to the Y screen.</p>

<p>Nelson Brothers offloaded RO water.</p>

<p>Spectra will be out tomorrow for the C3 and acid gas compressor motor.</p>
