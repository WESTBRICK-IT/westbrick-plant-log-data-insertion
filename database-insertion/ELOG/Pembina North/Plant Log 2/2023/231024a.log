<p>Weather cool -14</p>

<p>Production tank at 3.60 confirmed</p>

<p>Dumped F-3102</p>

<p>Dumped V-3050</p>

<p>Checked the contactor level,</p>

<p>At 12:15 the battery went into a mode 3 because the Lazer transmitter glitch giving a false level. Went down to confirm the level with a temp gun and level was good at 3.4 meters. The transmitter reset itself after approx 15 minutes. Both recycle pumps went down with the mode 3. Restarted B pump but A would not restart after several attempts. Submitted a work order to look at the pump #6081901</p>

<p>Submitted a service request to look into the transmitter #6081903 and also submitted a Maximo #36198 for the transmitter issue.</p>
