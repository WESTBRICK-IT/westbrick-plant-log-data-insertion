========================================
<p>Prod tank at 2.99, checked</p>

<p>Midwest deliverd C3</p>

<p>used fuel gas to push liquids out of the 2nd and 3rd stages of the AG comp</p>

<p>Nelsons delivered RO H2O</p>

<p>Chad pigged the Dominion line( pulled ) and pigged WPNE</p>

<p>Hyduk out to spot the picker</p>

<p>Sartec out to service the HVac systems</p>

<p>SR submitted for K206 2nd stage cyl temp not reading correct, #6071264</p>

<p>Chad scoped out the gas redirect for the shutdown</p>

<p>safety bypass form filled in for the AG low pipeline pressure. Daren lowered the shutdown to -100kpa to avoid trips untill the system is back on line</p>

<p>Tri Energy working on the scaffolding</p>

<p>Contact worked spotted a spot on the road south of the annex and reported it as a posible leak, Karen D submitted a hazard ID. PH sample was neutral and a chloride sample was 0. Shut in 11-22 well at the well and in the annex, pressure on the line is 650 KPA reading the gauge at the well. Line locators will be out tommorow to determine the location of the 11-22 flow line. Other lines in the area are suspended. Suspect it is just ground water.</p>

<p>Karen and Chris did worksite inspections of the scaffolding and targeted inspections of a permite and binder</p>
