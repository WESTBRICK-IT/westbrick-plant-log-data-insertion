========================================
<p>Weather cool -10 in the morning warming up to -2 in the afternoon</p>

<p>Production tank level at 3.33, confirmed</p>

<p>Lpg Bullet pressure at 258 kpa , volume 378 m3</p>

<p>Found a CO leak in the Volcano boiler builing, packed up and check to see where it was coming from but could not pin point the spot. Jeff from Cynthia is to stop by tomorrow with his IR camera to find the exact location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Completed a JHID on running the Volcano boiler with the CO leak until we can come up with a repair plan. It is on the table in the control room and operations are to sign off on it. We are to continue checking the boiler once a shift but operations are to enter building with scba as per the JHID.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Operations are to document CO reading in e-log to verify the leak isn&#39;t getting any worse.</p>

<p>CO reading was 20ppm 6&quot; away from burner assembly.</p>

<p>Hiflow out to prove keylink meter.</p>
