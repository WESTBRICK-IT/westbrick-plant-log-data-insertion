========================================
<p>Temperature was 25 C&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turned down K-205, K-203, and K-202 to 800 RPM due to hot oil temps</p>

<p>Darren came to fix the water charge pump that would not start because transformer that was powered off at the acid gas well would not allow the water plant ESD to open</p>

<p>Zetta gas is coming into the splitter line and&nbsp;going to V-107. Shut in the EGGS</p>

<p>Brushed fuzz off air compressor and compressor screens</p>

<p>Northwest hauled out two loads of LPG. Equalizer valve currently open.</p>

<p>Lined up to the production tank</p>

<p>Cleaned all rags and absorbants, housekeeping.</p>

<p>Emptied garbages in plant and topped up clean rag bins. Ordered more absorbants and rags</p>

<p>Travis picked up 10&quot; blind at Cynthia and brought to Zetta</p>

<p>Applied SDS lables for&nbsp;oil containments</p>

<p>Vermillion brought on their 9-16 which brought a slug of liquids to V-3101</p>

<p>Turned both fans on the bulk cooler</p>

<p>Waterplant running tripped once on high oil pressure. Will need more resets throughout the night</p>
