========================================
<p>Weather was warm and a little windy</p>

<p>tank level was 3.97 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>K 206 went down on a local alarm&nbsp;</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t get alarm to clear called Darren in for help .</p>

<p>Darren found a short in the wiring on the 2nd stage scrubber level</p>

<p>WO for Darren was (6071772)</p>

<p>Needed to start K201 ,filled machine with glycol, and got her running.</p>

<p>&nbsp;After starting k-201 , we put K-203 into K- 206 mode and swung MP gas to k-201</p>

<p>After finding the bad wiring on K-206 we started that machine back up and put a laod on it .</p>

<p>We put k-203 back to the mp gas. we then took k-201&nbsp; down and drain the glycol back into the storage tank</p>

<p>Called pembina pipeline to start our pump , we still cut 1.5 % BS&amp;W and they shut us back in.</p>

<p>Turn off the single speed fan on the C3</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on underspeed at 12 am .Start machine back up and load it</p>

<p>Lost the C3 at the same time .started that compressor back up and loaded it .</p>
