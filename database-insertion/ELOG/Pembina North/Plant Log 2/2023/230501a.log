<p>Weather was warm and a little overcast</p>

<p>tank level was 3.50</p>

<p>no security issues at the braz north site</p>

<p>At shift change the plant was down after a power issue with our back up generator, K-206 panel has some problem with the programming couldn&#39;t get her to stay running.So we put K-203 into 206 mode and stated K-201. then we got the C3 running. Kevin was nice enough to come in help get the facility running.The inlet pressures were high and took the better part of the evening to get the line pack sucked down . We put K-204 on the front end of the plant. the debutanizer reflux accumulator wasn&#39;t building a level and struggled all night to regain a level in it, And has not built a level by the end of shift.</p>

<p>Filled up the skid steer with diesel ,</p>

<p>Completed the monthly truck inspection for the night shift truck ,and put a new insurance card in the truck</p>
