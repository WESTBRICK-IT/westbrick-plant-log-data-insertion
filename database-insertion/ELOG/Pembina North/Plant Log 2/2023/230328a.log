========================================
<p>weather was clear and cold -13 for lows</p>

<p>tank level was 3.51 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>No security issues at the braz north site</p>

<p>tighten the packing on the glycol pump</p>

<p>Skim amine charcoal filters</p>

<p>turn on the single speed fan on the C3 and turn off the two speed fan</p>

<p>V207 vessel was ringing in with high gas flow rates from the 11-22 well , maybe need to look at the orfice plate size</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor packing vent rang in a few times open the drain on the tanks under the floor for a few minutes then closed them it seems to have stopped alarm from ringing in</p>

<p>Mancal hauled in 7m3 of oil</p>
