========================================
<p>Weather at the start of shift was+8 cooling down to -8</p>

<p>The production tank at 1700 was 3.07, comfirmed with temp</p>

<p>V-103 high leveled a couple of times and was not dumping, blew down the level transmitter a couple of times and now seems to be dumping fine.</p>

<p>Tightened the packings on the south eg. pump</p>

<p>There was no security issues at Braz N</p>

<p>Had to reset the water plant several times, shutting down on high pressure. Level down by the end of the shift.</p>

<p>Drained lube oil form the Chiller de-oiler, the catch tank will need emptied out next time Rob Thirsk hauls in water.</p>

<p>Reviewed safety meeting minutes and csop&#39;s in cmds</p>
