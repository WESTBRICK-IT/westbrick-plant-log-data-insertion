<p>Weather was clear and lows of -5</p>

<p>tank level at 7 pm was 3.40 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Process H2S analyzer rang in with a false high alarm ,Which knocked K-205 down .We confirmed the analyzer was a false reading,drian the sample line to ensure there was no liquids in the sample point</p>

<p>Start k-205 total down time was less than 10 mins</p>

<p>Spread some sand around the facility as it was getting slippery in spots</p>
