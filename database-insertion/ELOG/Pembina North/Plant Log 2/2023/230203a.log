<p>Weather monstly cloudy but warmed up to +4</p>

<p>Jay with Surepoint repaced fluid end gaskets and all plungers and packings on the south EG pump. (P-3203B) Night shift Please monitor throughout night for excessive packing leaks</p>

<p>Jay with Surepoint did the sulair compressor PM</p>

<p>Completed the truck inspection for Unit #5774</p>

<p>Dumped K-203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Found the liquid dump on F-3102 Filter coalessor passing to the amine flash tank. Daren is looking for parts for the valve. The block valves are blocked in and operations will have to monitor and dump the level manually when needed. Summited a service request to either fix the valve or replace. (WO #6067040)</p>

<p>VFD FIC 3203 Flow control is on manual set at 45%. Trying to help maintain glycol flow. Had issues with flow and had to blow the meter down.</p>
