========================================
<p>Weather sunny, windy from the east and hot. +30</p>

<p>17:30 The fire to the west of the plant that was burning 2 nights ago started back up. Went for a drive to check it out and the south east wind was keeping it away from the plant. Still very smoky to the north west and west of Zeta.</p>

<p>18:30 North West arrived to load up Ngl. At 19:10 the driver notified the control room that he had a hydraulic oil spill. Summited a incident report #33050 cleaned up with soaker pads. Will need a little morecleanup in the daylight.</p>

<p>Wind stayed south east all night, monitored the cameras throughout the night for any flareups. All was good.</p>

<p>23:00 Second NorthWest NGL truck here to load.</p>

<p>Sped up all compression and opened up all the inlets.</p>

<p>Open the de bute gas to the treater to lower the pressure in the the de bute</p>

<p>travis spread some gravel around the plant and fix some erosion issues near the water plant</p>

<p>Cut the inlets back to keep compression cool enough to run</p>

<p><strong>Wildfire update</strong></p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t as many today around the plant as the last few days .</p>
