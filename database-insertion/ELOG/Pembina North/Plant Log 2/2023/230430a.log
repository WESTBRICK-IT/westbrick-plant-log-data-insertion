========================================
<p>Weather was nice and warm, 26 at the beginning of shift and lows of 10</p>

<p>tank level was 4.40 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>No security issues at the braz north site</p>

<p>Pembina pipeline tech was here at shift change . I witnessed the sample that was spun out and it did have a cut of 1% water and 1% wax</p>

<p>Equalized the tank and the recycle pump is on the shipping tank</p>

<p>checked the temp of the treater with a temp gun ,running the temp gun up the side of it looking for a pad . the temp of the treater wasn&#39;t consistent with a pad in the treater</p>

<p>Filled two wajax packs up with water and put them in the back of the gator</p>

<p>I also checked the trailer set up with water tank and hand pumps, the trailer is good to go although it can&#39;t be filled until it needs to be used . there is no jack on the front of the trailer so it can&#39;t be disconnect from the gator once its full</p>

<p>drain both ends of the inlet coalescer</p>
