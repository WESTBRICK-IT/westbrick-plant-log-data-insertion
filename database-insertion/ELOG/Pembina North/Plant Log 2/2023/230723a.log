<p>Elog was down last night July 23/23 ,This was last nights log</p>

<p>Weather was warm highs of 27</p>

<p>Pembina pipeline called the shut our pump in on high oil temp , checked the temp of the tank and it was around 40c</p>

<p>Switched the recycle pump to shipping tank after the overflow tank rang in with a low level alarm &nbsp; , and slowed down the rate of the recycle pump to 35m3 a day.</p>

<p>Called pembina at 3:30 and had them try our pump and it was cool enough to keep it running</p>

<p>Sped up compression at 10:30 pm and started to open the inlets back open had everything leveled out by midnight</p>
