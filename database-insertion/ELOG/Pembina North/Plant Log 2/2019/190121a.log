========================================
<p>Lowered the level in the glycol flash tank.</p>

<p>Glycol recycle valve started to swing. Put the valve on manual to line it out then back on auto.</p>

<p>Lowered the glycol flow rate. Hoping it would help with the glycol swinging so hard.</p>

<p>Glycol lined out at the end of the shift. Thinking it was the full moon that may have caused the issue&nbsp;and last nights eclipse that helped line it out????</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>
