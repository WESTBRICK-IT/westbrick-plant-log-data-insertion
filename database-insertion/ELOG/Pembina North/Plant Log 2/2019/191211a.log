========================================
<p>Water plant was ESD&#39;d from GGT hauling in. TR-101 couldnt dump. Reset ESD. TR-101 shutdown and low leveled a few times while dumping.</p>

<p>Had a hard time this AM with frost on the cooler banks. Had to sweep off numerous times. Acid gas condencer temp was up to 55 degrees and wasnt condencing in the accumulator, instead condencing in K-5000 scrubbers. Lost about 5% level in the reboiler (all water).</p>

<p>Amine concentration is now at 31 %. Will check again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Nightshift keep an eye on cooler banks for frost.</p>

<p>Chris Page delivered bulk oil.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu and Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator.</p>
