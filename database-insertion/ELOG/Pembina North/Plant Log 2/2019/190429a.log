========================================
<p>-K-202 4th stage scrubber dump was stuck open this morning, tried playing around with it to get it to dump properly, had Daren F. diagnose it, he figures the float is sticking and needs to be cleaned.</p>

<p>-HVO (Gw) hauled in 16m<sup>3 </sup>of RO water to offload into the East 400bbl tank by the amine building. Another load will be coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>-Kenny, Ryan J., Ken L. out to smart pig the splitter line with Keabray crew.</p>

<p>-Pumped up V-3101 glycol leg.</p>

<p>-GGT (Rob) out to haul Zeta produced water and to assist with Splitter smart pigging.</p>

<p>-Tyson T. took compressor and engine oil samples.</p>

<p>-Lots of people out today, Tri-Energy doing walkthroughs along with Bravo target safety.</p>

<p>-Opened louvers on K-203/202/201.</p>

<p>-HP cold sep was around 55% level and dump valve was at 100% open and level was slowly climbing. Pumped methanol through. All good.</p>

<p>-Turned the big methanol pump on and it was vapour locked. Had to bleed down discharge. Small methanol pump vapour locked after. Bled it down also.</p>

<p>-Sent in ditch water samples to Exova.</p>

<p>-Have to keep the LPG ethane content on spec. Otherwise we are getting shut in. Cut back lean oil from 130 to 100 m/day to ensure we stay on spec.</p>

<p>-Worked on perimiter blind list.</p>
