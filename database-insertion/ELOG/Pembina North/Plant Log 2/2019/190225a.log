========================================
<p>Topped up LPG oil lubricator.</p>

<p>Cleaned treater basket.</p>

<p>Add some glycol. Rate started bouncing around and still losing level. Adjusted level controller to control at around 3 bolts. Cycle methanol pump into gas to gas exchanger when differential started coming up (went up around 212 kPa). Pressure dropped and glycol level came up.</p>

<p>Closed K203 bottom louver. Will ring in compressor top cooler bank high temperature alarm if middle louver is totally closed. Run AC-3104B in slow.</p>
