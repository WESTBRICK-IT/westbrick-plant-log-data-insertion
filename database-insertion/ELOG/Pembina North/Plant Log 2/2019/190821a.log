<p>&nbsp;-Spartan worked on the Volcano boiler panel.</p>

<p>-Started circulating heating glycol pumps, found the union on the heating coil to the overhead process gycol tank leaking. We tried tighten it up with no luck so we depressured the line, opened the union and applied pipe dope and teflon tape. Retighten and seems to hold now. Can night shift please check on the union a couple of times for leaks.</p>
