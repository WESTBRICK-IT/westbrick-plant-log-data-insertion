========================================
<p>Kyle changed water filters.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricators.</p>

<p>Kevin T did H2S head calibrations in the rest of the plant.</p>

<p>Alex with corelabs did monthly gas samples.</p>

<p>Water on the go no longer does water deliveries, so I got ahold of Al to bring out some water.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu emulsion (4-28-49-11W5).</p>

<p>Rob hauled in 3 loads of Zeta water.</p>

<p>Called out the grader to scratch up the road and a loop through the plant.</p>

<p>Lowered De Eth bottoms temp from 96 to 93 degrees due to high reflux and lost top temps.</p>

<p>Pinched North Amine trim louvers a bit.</p>
