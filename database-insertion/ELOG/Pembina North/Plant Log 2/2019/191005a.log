========================================
<p>Vermilion pill batched V101 line.</p>

<p>K204 went down on high suction scrubber, suspected slugged came from Vermilion pigging and carry over a little bit of liquid.</p>

<p>Topped up glycol for the C3A compressor.</p>

<p>Kristina reset the alarm holding us out for the low second stage discharge of C3A. She said that switch might be sticky or dead band is a little bit wider.</p>

<p>C3A cylinder 3 and 5 were vibrating quite a bit. Kyle snugged the bracket underneath. Verified with Chris Nagy and he mentioned that it get loose every now and then. Just to make sure its snugged and not overtightened that will cause us issues with the packing.</p>

<p>Called Vermilion to start their well that was shut-in due to TCPL Rat Creek line.</p>

<p>Kim/Obsidian started up WPNA and PNA. PNA late this afternoon. WPNA is on manual at 100% (PIC-200). Night shift please put it in auto once PNA de-pressure. PNA PIC-203 is in auto at 340 kPa and its pinching it.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Zeta water and did some containments around the plant.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Mancal and Baccaleau.</p>

<p>Set V-200 LIC-200 stop level from 5% to 20 %.</p>

<p>Kyle changed out water plant filter once.</p>

<p>Adjusted de-eth temperature from 92 to 94 C.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter, clean. Drained chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>Kyle cleaned up staining around transformer for Kevin.</p>
