<p>Adjusted K-203 top and bottom louver control setpoints from 43 to 45 to raise inlet temp, dropped back down to 43 around lunch time.</p>

<p>Called Terrence with Vermillion about V-103 and V-101 level transmitter issues, he turned on another methanol pump doing 50L/Day and increased a pump from 10L/Day to 30L/Day.</p>

<p>Increased reboiler temp setpoint TIC-4300 to 35 from 33 to help raise the regen tops temp.</p>
