<p>&nbsp;Pumped out flare knock out. Set water flash tank from 370 kPa to 230 kPa.Set level controller from 40-30 to 50-30 and see if it will have enough head pressure to prime the pump. Please monitor. Thanks.</p>

<p>Lost K208 on 1st stage suction high level. Pump won&#39;t catch prime to&nbsp;pump the liquid. Tried increasing the recycle control valve but still not enough to prime the pump even if its already&nbsp;wide open. Ended up opening the 1&quot; fuel gas line by K208 boot suction line to increase the head pressure before it went down again the second time.</p>

<p>Open up K203 engine vent a little bit more to slow down leak on the shaft.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Eric/HVO hauled in one load from Baccaliau. He&#39;ll be back for one more load and another load from Velvet.</p>

Tried increasing the recycle control valve but still not enough to prime the pump even if its already&nbsp;wide open. Set it back down.&nbsp;Ended up opening the 1&quot; fuel gas line by K208 boot suction line to increase the head pressure before it went down again the second time (2:00 AM). Looks like around 6 hours before it build up enough level to start the pump.</p>

<p>Open up K203 engine vent a little bit more to slow down leak on the shaft. Checked it out around 4:30 AM and nothing dripping anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Changed out amine bag filter.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Found methanol injection open on the gas off of the chiller for the de-eth.&nbsp; Closed valve to force all methanol to the inlet.&nbsp; Slowed methanol injection to 50 from 60.</p>

<p>Blew down sight glass and level transmitter on lean oil.&nbsp; Sight glass level was way out.&nbsp; Level indication was accurate.&nbsp; All good now.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a couple of oil.&nbsp; One Baccaleiu and one Velvet.</p>

<p>Core labs out to get weekly samples.</p>

<p>Tyson did 3 month PM&#39;s on both sullair compressors.</p>

<p>K-208 scrubber not dumping.&nbsp; Had to swing to flare and then back to boot when it started pumping.</p>

<p>Pro-active gas find on site for annual gas leak detection.</p>

<p>Elite out doing floboss cals.</p>
