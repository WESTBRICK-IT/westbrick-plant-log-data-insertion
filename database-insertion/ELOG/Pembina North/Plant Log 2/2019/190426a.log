========================================
<p>BS&amp;W started to ring in and out early in the AM. Put one pump in each tank and batched some SRW and DMO. Swung back into both after a few hours. BS&amp;W hanging in there.</p>

<p>Called Cynthia and told them to truck to Bigoray first to give us time to get our BS&amp;W lower and deal with the levels abit.</p>

<p>Recieved three loads of Baccalieu emulsion from HVO.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Zeta water.</p>

<p>Kenny and Ryan pigged the splitter line. They ran two pigs because the first one was quite dirty. Lots of liquids, hit pretty hard.</p>

<p>V-101 hi level multiple times. Flow completly dropped off for awhile. Called the lead, turns out they closed the valve to us to pig a lateral twice. Then randomly sent us a pig.</p>

<p>Put the two speed condencer fan on fast.</p>

<p>Filled up water containers for fire fighting.</p>

<p>Overhead crane inspectors out.</p>

<p>Keabrey out pressure testing steam line.</p>

<p>Tri Energy crews out doing misc tasks including more scaffolding.</p>
