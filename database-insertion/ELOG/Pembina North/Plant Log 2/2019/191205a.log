========================================
<p>Filled the Herman Nelson heaters and fired up to keep everything hot for startup in the AM.</p>

<p>Blew down the inlet coalescer, horizontal coalescer, cyclone seperator and fuel gas scrubbers.</p>

<p>Ensured methanol was pumping down the EGG line.</p>

<p>Process methanol pumps were both vapour locked. Worked on them for abit and got them pumping.</p>

<p>Sent off drawings for V-300 to Keabray.</p>

<p>Lost flow through the amine contactor. Differential pressure between contactor pressure and sales recyle back to K-206 suction. Cycled methanol pump through the gas/gas exchanger and got flow back. Hydrate must have formed in the exchanger again. Keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Worked on ADR and submitted.</p>

========================================
<p>Swung production back through the plant this morning.&nbsp; Started up K-205 and K202.&nbsp;&nbsp; Production is back to normal for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vermillion cak into V-101 and V-103.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mancal back into V-107.&nbsp;&nbsp; WPNE line is froze off and the field operators are tending to it.</p>

<p>Field swung the lines in the field for the redirect.</p>

<p>Brought &quot;B&quot; C3 compressor back on line after repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut down for leaks and put back on line.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 on high first stage discharge pressure bringing on V-200.</p>

<p>Lost K-205 on low suction, due to ESD -7000 shutting due to warm gas (3 hour timer ran out).</p>

<p>2 loads of Zeta water hauled in by Rob.</p>

<p>Crew out to remove tarps.</p>

<p>Called ACR for the heaters to be picked up.</p>

<p>Sales Analyzer tape rang in on low tape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a bit on the roll but monitor.</p>

<p>Lost c3 at the end of the day, worked on it until night shift relived us.</p>
