========================================
<p>Started up water plant after the Acid squeeze on the well, checked for leaks.</p>

<p>1 Load of Emulsion hauled in by HVO.</p>

<p>Added a little bit of glycol from overhead tank.</p>

<p>K-208 down on 1st stage scrubber level, increased suction pressure and BOL.</p>

<p>Recycle pump in truck offload.</p>

<p>Pinched K-201, K-202, K-203 louvers.</p>

<p>B;ow down V-101 level controller a couple times.</p>

========================================
<p>-Added oil to the LPG packing lubricators.</p>

<p>-Blew down V-101 level transmitter twice. Pat/Vermilion pushed/slugged batch some methanol in the line. Injection rates is around 350 to 400 LPD.</p>

<p>-HVO (Trent) hauled in 3 loads of Baccalieu emulsion, 6-16-49-11W5 x2, and 1-19-49-11W5.</p>

<p>-Kristina function tested the TCPL ESD at braz, lost K-205.</p>

<p>-GGT (Rob) hauled in Braz &amp; Zeta produced water.</p>

<p>-Cleaned the basket strainer on the treater.</p>

<p>-K-208 down on hi 1st stage suction scrubber level.</p>

<p>-Amine water make-up from 20 to 22%. Concentration is at 43%.</p>

<p>-Kevin T scoped heat tracing V101. Wired heater for H2S amine analyzer regulator.</p>

<p>-Devin run methanol line into V101. Can be use once we have some methanol in the tank. Need to open the tubing valve and purge the line still. There&#39;s an internal PSV in the pump.</p>

<p>- Mechanics cleaning up around K206. Tyson checked FKO pump.</p>

<p>- De-ethanizer bottom temp set from 78 to 80C.</p>

<p>-Topped up meropa oil of amine charge pump.</p>

<p>- CO2 blending is now online. If 7-11 alarm, we need to reset the ESD on the screen. Proceed to location and manually reset the panel and pump the hydraulic ESD. Setpoint for flow is at 150 E3M3.</p>

<p>-Open K202, 201 and 203 louvers a little bit.</p>

<p>-Batched treater with 5 gal of SRW6990 to take some Iron from the water. At 9:30 and 3:00PM.</p>

<p>-Set V107 PY1076 from 900 to 1000 kPa.</p>

<p>-Sent WO to have Kevin check the fan for FKO building heater.</p>

<p>- Set glycol roots from 8 to 8.8 ( 14.5 M3/day to 15.7 M3/day). Glycol concentration still low at lean - 66.4, rich - 63.5.</p>

<p>- Skimmed charcoal amine filter, 1 jug of oil.</p>

<p>- Blew down chiller de-oiler.</p>
