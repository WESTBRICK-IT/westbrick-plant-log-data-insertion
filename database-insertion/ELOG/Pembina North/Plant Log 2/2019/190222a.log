========================================
<p>Water injection well pressuring up to 9450 kPa and knocking down pump on high discharge. Need somebody to look into the well.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>Air pump in the flare knockout building is leaking air. Pinched supply air to stop leaking air and slow the pump. Sent work order.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 1 load from Baccaleau 1-19-49-11.</p>

<p>Skimmed Amine charcoal filter. Got 6 sample jugs of oil before it cleared.</p>

<p>Hi leveled de ethanizer reflux accumulator. Pumped some methanol and it broke free.</p>

<p>Changed out V101 dump valve range from 35-25 to 35-30 to let V200 and V3101 time to dump into the treater.</p>

<p>Nextsource crew out to assist Kevin T with Heat Trace power for on top of the hill Vermillion inlet</p>

<p>Bigshow on site installing scaffolding for shut down next week, will return on Monday to finish</p>

<p>Water Plant volumes- Seem to be having well issues, pressuring up, Kelly is aware, charge pump will run for approx 2 hrs then shut down on high discharge press (9400 kpa) at the well, we will have to monitor until a plan is in place to work on well, when water filter canister dp bypasses, make sure to change over to the other filter can as soon as possible. Build up in the well will get worse, in the meantime we will run just the booster pumps. Checked the polymer vent at the well, 9400KPA, no signs of leaking.</p>

<p>ShutDown Prep, Scope, Loto</p>

<p>Kevin &amp; Kristina working on 7-11 risor</p>

<p>V101-higher flow volumes today from Vermillion, slugging &amp; highflows causing issues with dump, highleveling &amp; backing out other vessels from dumping liquids to the treater, adjusting back pressure control to keep consistant flows to compression &amp; avoiding over ranging meter dp</p>

<p>V107- seeing volumes today for Vermillion Cardium new well 9-16 liquids &amp; gas</p>

<p>Daren installed DCS screens for Vermillion 9-16 Cardium well which flows into V107, &amp; 16-02 well which flows into the splitter pipeline should have all the bugs out by Monday</p>

<p>Flare Knockout pump, Tyson looked at it, we drained some liquids out of gas supply line, &amp; unvapour locked it, now pumping, will monitor on the weekend when completing weekend checks</p>

<p>Tyson cleaning up from K205 overhaul, metal to the scap bin etc</p>

<p>Added Amine from the underground tank slowly few times today, Had Tyson look at the pump as well due to it leaking slightly, tightened up will monitor</p>

<p>N2 level are hanging around 1.1 to 1.3 % with the new vermillion wells on</p>

<p>CO2 levels are hanging around 1 %.</p>

<p>Keltech communication had them come out to check all the radio&#39;s, due to poor communication lately, the newer Motorola&#39;s are working fine all over the plant, require two new antenas for them, the older Kenwoods are getting worse they are only working with in half of the facility, all base radio&#39;s are working good, also between the 3 facilities on the linked channels are working properly, but only on the newer motorola&#39;s, some of the Kenwoods would not pickup anything.</p>

<p>LEL head rang in on K-204 South, checked for leaks, found a leak on Cylinder #2 inboard suction valve, bypassed LEL detection, notified Tyson T. he is heading out, handed over to nightshift.</p>
