<p>6-19 ESD rang in closed, was in travel but actually did close, had Perry reset.</p>

<p>Changed Amine bag filter.</p>

<p>Changed valves in K-205 1st cylinder discharge, ran K-204 in sales while it was down.</p>

<p>Changed 2 valves on the C3 compressor 1st stage suction on the south west side.</p>

<p>Devin worked on the De Eth dump valve, running much better now.</p>

<p>Several power flicks due to wind knocked down the volcano, hot oil heater, Amine trim cooler, recycle pumps, and water plant.</p>

<p>Froze off in the Gas to Gas, knocked down K203 on high pressure.&nbsp; Methanolled the inlet and broke free, BOL.</p>

<p>Reflux pump seal leaked.&nbsp; Put in W.O. and Chris fixed while here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to go back in service.</p>

<p>Put De Bute back into Low pressure due to flaring.</p>

<p>Started De Eth methanol pump.</p>

<p>Process ESD&#39;d knocking down K205&nbsp;and nothing flagged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Devin found it was the temp going to the HP sep reached 10 degrees.&nbsp; Will W.O.</p>

<p>Lowered De Bute temp from 100 to 70 degrees.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in braz water.</p>
