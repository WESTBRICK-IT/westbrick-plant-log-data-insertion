========================================
<p>Fought with V-101. Couldnt get the level to control properly even right after it was blown down. Pumped methanol through sight glass and into sensing lines. Still no luck. Lots of hydrate material. Called Vermilion and got them to cut back flow. Lined out within an hour of cutting back production.</p>

<p>Chiller differential pressure climbed up to 180 kpa. Cycle methanol pump once. Seemed to help lower the DP abit. Chiller still isnt as cold as it should be.</p>

<p>Big methanol pump wouldnt pump due to vapour lock. When opening up the valves it also vapour locked the small pump. Has to bleed off both discharge lines to get them pumping again.</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-202, 201 and K-203 to warm up amine contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the cyclone seperator.</p>

<p>Adjusted de bute overhead cooler fan speed to maintain 900+ kpa on the de bute tower.</p>

<p>Put the 2 speed condencer fan on slow to help out contactor inlet temp. Had to put it back on fast because the c3 accumulator started to pressure up.</p>

<p>Pembina pumped us down again tonight. BS&amp;W was good. Left recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; in the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Glycol level in the accumulator jumping around. Flash tank and glycol sep levels are all good. Assuming its hanging up in the still column.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;amine conc 47% increased make up</p>

<p>ordered C3, should be here tommorow</p>

<p>V-101 issues most of the day</p>

<p>V-107 high leveled a few times</p>

<p>Vermilion batched methanol in the morning, hit us with slugs around 10:00</p>

<p>Bigshow on site removing scaffolding</p>

<p>Tyson replaced belt on the west C3 fan. west fan on line 2speed on slow</p>

<p>pembina started pumps, BS&amp;W was high, batched the treater</p>

<p>opened loouvers on the amine</p>

<p>flow dropped off on V-101 for 2hrs the hit us with a slug after a hydrate let loose, flow dropped off later due to anouther hydrate in the field, Terrence will be be batching again, hydrate brock free at 17:00</p>

<p>Tyson working on recycle A</p>

<p>took treater sample for Baker, samples are in the lab.</p>

<p>Cleaned recycle pump &quot;B&quot; basket and meter, lots of pig parts.</p>
