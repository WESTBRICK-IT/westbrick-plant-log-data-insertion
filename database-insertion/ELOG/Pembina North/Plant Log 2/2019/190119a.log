========================================
<p>Glycol level not maintaining in the accumulator. Glycol sep was full and not dumping.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Pumped methanol backwards through the dump control valve. Started dumping hard after. Lots of foam in the system.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -After getting the system semi lined out cut back the dump controller to maintain 80-90% level in the accumulator. The glycol seperator is still quite full of glycol. Will have to adjust glycol sep dump valve as needed. However, when dumping it tends to pressure up the flash tank and foam pretty hard.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Cut back the glycol flow rate to 6.3 roots from 6.5 roots as the pumps seemed to suck the level out of the accumulator faster than it could fill.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Having a hard time getting the flash tank to dump. Have been having to dump it directly to the reconcentrator the odd time. Possibly a restriction going to the still column??? Seems to dump, just not as much as normal. Pumped through with a baker pump.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Bypassed glycol filters temperarily to confirm they were not plugged. All good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Had issues getting the c3 compressor to load.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Opened the flare line off the top of the c3 condencer to flare off any potential non condencables for approx 1 hour.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Tunred on the de bute fans and increased the fan speed to 10% to lower the de bute pressure and take some load off of the c3 compressor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Lowered the c3 accumulator pressure to 815 kpa to take some load off of the c3 compressor.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Opened the chain operated valve back up to the condencer side of the chiller and closed&nbsp;off the bypass slowly as the c3 suction pressure dropped. Currently waiting on product to build in the accumulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Opened the hot gas bypass valve up. (control valve still closed).</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Added c3 to the accumulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp; -Turned off P-3101 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; de eth reflux pump so it wasnt running with no product in the reflux accumulator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talked to Terrence with Vermilion. They have a well down for frac that goes into V-101.&nbsp; Approx 55 e3m3 and 35 m/day of condy&nbsp;we will be short for a couple days. He will call us when they decide to kick the well back on. His number is (780) 621-1072.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-202 compressor to increase inlet temp to amine contactor.</p>
