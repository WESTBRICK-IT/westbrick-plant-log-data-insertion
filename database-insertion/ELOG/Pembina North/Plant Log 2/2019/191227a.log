<p>-Ordered amine makeup water, Nelson will deliver tomorrow.</p>

<p>-Swung 1-21 into V-3101 at 11:45 am, not flowing into V-200. Checked pressures on the line to V-200 and we confirmed that the higher pressures is at the Argus valve just before the pipe goes into the ground. We isolated that piece of pipe and we left over night and nightshift is aware and can monitor.</p>
