========================================
<p>At start of shift, helped crossshift get plant up and running after power bump.</p>

<p>Reset VFD&#39;s for overhead cooling fans and glycol injection pumps.</p>

<p>Reset K-208 multilyn and started.</p>

<p>Found E-3101 was froze off on plant inlet side.&nbsp; Started injecting methanol and increased glycol flow rate.&nbsp; Added glycol from overhead tank.</p>

<p>K-203 ramps up to over a 1000 rpm and shuts down.&nbsp; Called out Chris Nagy.&nbsp; Found carb linkage was very stiff.&nbsp; Pulled apart and lubricated and reassembelled.&nbsp; Restarted, all good.</p>

<p>Once K-203 was up and running, did a plant warm up for a couple hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut down the C3 compressor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally got the DP on E-3101 to drop.&nbsp; Restarted C3A.</p>
