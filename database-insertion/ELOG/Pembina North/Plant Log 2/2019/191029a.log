<p>Hot oil pump pressure down to 395 KPA and surge tank was up to 350 KPA. Found the sensing line from the hot oil surge tank to the controller that relieves pressure to the hot oil pop tank was plugged and reading a false pressure. The surge tank pressure was actually at 0 KPA.&nbsp;Got Devin to set up and adjust the fuel gas pressure controller and the relief controller to the pop tank. Surge tank pressure set to 320 KPA and pump pressure back up to 640 KPA.</p>
