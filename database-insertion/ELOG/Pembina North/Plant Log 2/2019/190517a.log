========================================
<p>Changed amine bag filter.&nbsp; X2.&nbsp; Installed oil absorbing bags.</p>

<p>Reflux pumps gas locking when purging bag filters.&nbsp; Found dump valve to drain header from reflux accumulator slightly open.&nbsp; Closed.</p>

<p>Lowered amine make-up water to 15 from 25.</p>

<p>Close acid gas pipeline ESD to flare.&nbsp; Could not build pressure on acid gas.&nbsp; After trouble shooting found that the inlet relief to flare was tracking open for some reason.&nbsp; Put in manual to zero and back to auto and has been good since.&nbsp; Opened ESD&#39;s at well.</p>

<p>Raised tarps and opened all louvers on amine trim cooler.&nbsp; Amine was up to 50 degrees.&nbsp; Also found only one fan was on.&nbsp; Only runs when switch is in the hand position.&nbsp; Does not run in the auto position??</p>

<p>Set up recycle pump B to pull out of the old truck offload line.</p>

<p>Found horizontal coalescer dumps blocked in.&nbsp; Opened up to amine skim tank and blew down.</p>

<p>Blew down amine reflux flow transmitter again.</p>

<p>Acid Gas compressor oil level out of the sightglass.&nbsp; Added from overhead tank to crank case.</p>
