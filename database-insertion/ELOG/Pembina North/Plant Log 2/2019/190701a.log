========================================
<p>Added c3 to accumulator.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>Turned on the exhaust fan and opened up louvers on wall vent in the hot oil heater building. Was pretty warm inside.</p>

<p>Recieved a load of Cynthia oil from HVO.</p>

<p>De eth reflux meter pinned, tops temp warming up and c3 suction pressure climbing. Lowered the de eth bottoms temp from 98 to 97 degrees. Reflux flow came back down and tops temp cooled off again.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the inlet coalescer.</p>

<p>Floor drains on amine skid are full and not draining. Will have to get Rob to suck out the drain tank.</p>
