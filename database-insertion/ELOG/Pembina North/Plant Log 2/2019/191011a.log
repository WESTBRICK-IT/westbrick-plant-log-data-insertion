========================================
<p>&nbsp;Assisted the Day shift to bring on equipment after outage.</p>

<p>Lost C3 &quot;A&quot; 2x on high suction scrubber level, had Devon check the shut down swith for 2nd stage discharge temp as it would not clear.</p>

<p>Added C3 to surge tank.</p>

<p>Lowered De Eth bottoms temp from 92 to 75 degrees as the lean oil is down.</p>

<p>Opened up V-200 as the set points were off.</p>

<p>Opened up the hot gas bypass on the C3 chiller.</p>

<p>Slowed the De bute fans.</p>

<p>Got the Acid gas compressor to run, going down on 3rd stage high level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Took a couple of trys to get the level down.</p>

<p>turned off the C3 condeser fan, and increased the surge tank pressure from 900 to 1000kpa.&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep a load on the compressor.</p>

<p>Shut off the acid gas blend to flare.</p>

<p>Raised bulk cooler temps to 30 degrees to keep a load on the C3 comp.</p>

<p>Closed louvers on K-201, and K-208.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amine inlet still running cool.</p>

<p>7-11 blend gas ESD&#39;d at 0400, could not get it to reset.</p>

<p>Started recycle pumps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;7-11 Risor Esd tripped 3x early this morning, Daren &amp; Devin looking into it.</p>

<p>Iconic working on Keylink gas detection, will return next week to continue</p>

<p>Shut down Keylink pumps, Tyson recharged discharge bladder to required pressure, back in service, sounds good now. Found one tubing fitting leaked, swapped out and submitted MITS.</p>

<p>Daren &amp; Devin&nbsp;going over small gliches from yesterday&#39;s shut down.</p>

<p>PSV for K206 returned today, will be shutting down the plant Saturday Oct 12/19 @ 8:00 in order to install, Keabray crew booked to assist, Maintence will be out incase of issues</p>

<p>Romeo working on Worksite inspection items</p>

<p>Volcano boiler, added more glycol today to get better level for cooler&nbsp;ambient temps, &nbsp;continue to monitor level, needed to shut unit pumps&nbsp;down to add&nbsp;due to&nbsp;system pressure, back on line. Added to Chemical usage sheet</p>

<p>Started on Week end checks.</p>

<p>Univar(Clayton&#39;s Distriburtors) delivered 9 m3 of Amine, filled above storage tank.</p>
