========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Pembina pumps down for most of the day because of high bs&amp;w, called HVO dispatch and Cynthia plant to let them know we are not takeing any trucked in oil because of high tank levels and treater issues.</p>

<p>-Call Taggert and he came out to trouble shoot the problem, taking sample all over the treater and tanks and finding lots of suspended solids in the oil and water making water very dirty.</p>

<p>-Got Rob Thirsk to pump off 40 m3 of oil out of the production tank and put it in the overflow tank to help get rid of some the water.</p>

<p>-Got Rob to pump off 10 m3 off emulsion off the treater back to help get rid of some of the solids in the oil. He off loaded it into the slop tanks in the battery.</p>

<p>-Change a set of water plant filters.</p>

<p>-Recycle b pump is down and left down and recycle a is pumping out of the producion tank at a rate of 50m3 a day.</p>
