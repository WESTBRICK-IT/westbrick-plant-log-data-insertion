========================================
<p>&nbsp;Batched SCW, and DMO 2x today, due to lost interface and started going wet.</p>

<p>Shut down K-202 to LOTO and Blind for Overhaul starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>Swapped the dump lines to flare from boot on the K206 compressor, as it was pressureing up the boot.</p>

<p>Got 3 load from Cynthia hauled in by HVO, and 2 loads of Baccalieu.</p>

<p>Tried to run both recycle pumps in the Overflow tank but started going wet right away, left as one recycle in each tank.</p>
