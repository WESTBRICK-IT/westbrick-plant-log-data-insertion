========================================
<p>Went over MOC meeting at start of shift. Decided to shut all compressors down and just run K-204 and discharge Vermilion down the EGG line to Bigoray.</p>

<p>Around 1AM after feild specs were flipped and 7-22 and 6-19 valves were open went to offload Vermilion down sales but could not get the Splitter ESD to open. Solenoid burnt out and not functioning. Did not want to jumper the solenoid because we would have no control over the ESD. Will have to get maintenance to install a new solenoid and fire up K-204 and offload after.</p>

<p>Swung K-204 discharge valves into the &#39;&#39;offload&#39;&#39; position to the EGG line.</p>

<p>Got ridgeback 6-12 and Obsidian 6-19 flowing to Bigoray. Approx 115 e3m3. Notified Bigoray of the volumes. 15-10 Ridgeback still not flowing due to compressor issues.</p>

<p>Shutdown and depressured all compressors and closed all the inlets.</p>

<p>Eventually lost the acid gas compressor on low pipeline pressure. Have a small leak in the acid gas wellhead building. Will have to look into today.</p>

<p>Cracked the fuel gas valve to the amine reboiler to flow fuel gas through the acid gas condencer and out to flare to eliminate any freezing in the cooler bank.</p>

<p>Shortly after shift change the amine bulk cooler froze off and pressure climbed very fast. Raised the temps on the cooler and slowed the fan down. No luck. Got the pressure truck to try and pump methanol through it but couldnt flow more than 0.3 L/min. Cynthia brought out a Herman Nelson heater and Keabray will be bringing out insulated tarps to thaw it out today.</p>

<p>Turned on heaters in buildings and closed roof vents.</p>

<p>Numerous walk throughs looking for any issues etc.</p>

<p>Shut off the bulk cooler fan.</p>

<p>Shut off the c3 condencer fan.</p>

<p>Shut off debute reflux pump.</p>

========================================
<p>Started up K-204 and started flowing Vermilion to Bigoray around 10am.&nbsp; Once line pack was down, swung Mancal back into V-103 and stated flowing to K-204 and off to Bigoray.</p>

<p>Adjusted louvers on K-204 and K-203 to help increase discharge temp.&nbsp; Was at 24 degrees on K-204, now up to 42 degrees.</p>

<p>Keabray on site helping mechanics and Apecs disassemble&nbsp;C3B (K-3301) compressor and prepare for shipping.</p>

<p>Keabray blinded out C3B compressor.</p>

<p>Mezei Inspection LTD out to do&nbsp;MPI/LPI inspection of K-3301 cylinders.</p>

<p>KPA on site to pump methanol down splitter line to crossover to Bigoray.</p>

<p>Kristina got the methanol pump in the annex building pumping good to the splitter.&nbsp; Had Mark Spelrum bring a small tank from Cynthia over to set up for Inhibited methanol.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu.</p>

<p>ACR hauled out some Herman Nelsons in case we need them.&nbsp; Will look at setting them in place tomorrow.</p>

<p>Kevin Toone out at 5-21.&nbsp; Set methanol pump up for injection to EGGS line.&nbsp; Set for 42L/Day.&nbsp; And set 6-19 injection for 17L/Day.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk hauled in Braz and Zeta water for disposal.</p>

<p>Kevin Toone fixed VFD switch for the gas cooler fan.</p>
