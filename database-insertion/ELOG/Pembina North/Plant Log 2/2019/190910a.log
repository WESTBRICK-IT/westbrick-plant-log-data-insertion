<p>&nbsp;Rob filled up our methanol tank.</p>

<p>K-202 down on 2nd stage scrubber high level, found dump line froze off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pumped methanol to free up and BOL.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 while starting up K-202,&nbsp; BOL.</p>

<p>Taggart out to look at water plant samples.HVO hauled in 4 loads of Baccalieu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased our scale inhibitor rate at the treater from 7l/d to 14l/d.&nbsp;&nbsp; coming back in a couple days to take more samples.</p>

<p>Rob grabbed some Braz water and skimmed the water tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sucked out skim tank and put it in the over flow.</p>

<p>Pumped out Amine skid drain tank.</p>

<p>Put water plant back in service, changed water filters 4x.&nbsp; Pumps only run for 15 minutes before the&nbsp;filters plug off.</p>

<p>Left water plant down with the ESD bypass open.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put recycle in the production tank,&nbsp;&nbsp; Need to let the water tanks settle out before pumps can run.</p>
