========================================
<p>-Hot oil heater went down 3 times this morning, 2 times on &quot;FSG Alarm&quot; and 1 time on &quot;Low flow&quot;, lowered outlet temp to 223 from 225, all good.</p>

<p>-Lean oil down on low accumulator level, blew down sight glass and level transmitter, also had Devin N. look at inlet control valve, found it wasn&#39;t opening all the way. all good.</p>

<p>-Pinched louvers on K-204 to help warm up fuel gas coming off of sales gas.</p>

<p>-Increased amine water make-up from 10 to 17.</p>

<p>-K-202 down twice on lube oil no-flow, Tyson T. purged the tubing lines, he assumed there was air in the tubing lines, all good now.</p>

<p>-Jayden with KPA out with a pressure truck and methanol to fill up the WPNA / PNA pig catcher, was able to clear the ice plug from the pig catcher, also had issues with PNA inlet ESD valve, found a blockage in the air line.</p>

<p>-PNA inlet to V-200 has a hydrate, ESD and actuator valves are heat traced but not insulated, insulated the piping hoping to have it melt, PNA is running through the pig catcher and going into V-200 through the WPNA inlet for the time being.</p>

<p>-Increased debut bottoms temp to 100 degrees from 96.</p>

<p>-Marty and Glen with GGT out hauling 3 loads on 3-28 Cynthia emulsion.</p>

<p>-Shane with HVO hauled in a load of 6-16 Baccalieu emulsion.</p>
