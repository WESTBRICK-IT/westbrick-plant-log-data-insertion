========================================
<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the overflow.</p>

<p>Lean oil flow rate dropped to zero.&nbsp; Shutdown pumps and blew down level column and sightglass.&nbsp; Restarted.</p>

<p>HP cold seperator keeps high leveling and knocking down the lean oil. X3. &nbsp; Added methanol to E-3101 a couple times.&nbsp; Also checked back pressure control valve for plant to make sure its wide open and not JTing the gas.&nbsp; Something finally let loose in the cold sep around 4:30.</p>

<p>No reflux showing on the amine regen.&nbsp; Increased tops temp controler from 39% to 40%.</p>
