========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Hvo hauled in multiple loads of Baccaleau emulsion.</p>

<p>-Nelson Bros delivered amine makeup water.</p>

<p>-Filled the lean oil lube tank.</p>

<p>-Tarpon crew out to work on the&nbsp;Volcano boiler upgrades.</p>

<p>-Elite line locating out locating for the new gate install.</p>

<p>-Boss Hog delivered a load of Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>-Shut down K-205 to repair a glycol leak on the engine. Had to drain some of the glycol out in order for Devin to&nbsp;repair it. When restarting the compressor it kept going down on high suction pressure, Daren thinks that maybe some of the set points may have changed during one of the power bumps we had. Finally got it to stay running.</p>

<p>-Chris Page delivered bulk oil.</p>

<p>-Core Labs out doing monthly samples.</p>

<p>-Baker delivered 2 barrels of chemical, one scale inhibitor and one corrosion inhibitor.</p>
