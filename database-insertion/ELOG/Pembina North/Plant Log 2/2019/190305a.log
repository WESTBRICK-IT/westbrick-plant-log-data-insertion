========================================
<p>Chiller differential pressure was over 180 kpa and chiller temp was around -22. Shutdown the c3 compressor for just over an hour to do a warm up.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler after start up. Lots of lube oil. Dayshift can you blow down the de-oiler a couple times through out the day please.</p>

<p>Process water level low. Dayshift can you order process water from Nelson Bros please. Maybe call &#39;&#39;Keyera Buck Lake Minihik&#39;&#39; plant first to verify they have enough water for us.</p>

<p>Recycle pump packing hanging in there.</p>

<p>Lost recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;. Sped pump up and turned it back on as it was going down on low flow.</p>

<p>Turned off the 2 speed c3 condencer fan due to ambiant temps cooling down.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the cyclone seperator.</p>

<p>Closed louvers on K-202, 208, 201 and K-203 compressors to warm up the amine contactor&nbsp;inlet temp.</p>

<p>Adjusted de bute overhead fan speed to maintain 900 kpa debute pressure.</p>

<p>Lowered the c3 accumulator pressure setpoint from 970 kpa to 940 kpa to help lower the suction pressure on the c3 compressor abit.</p>

<p>Added oil to amine charge pump crank case.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 on first stage scrubber level. Increased LP to boot makeup contoller to help the pump to grab suction.</p>

========================================
<p>Set De-ethanizer bottom temperature from 77 to 78.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 45%. Set RO water pump from 17 to 20. Kyle ordered some RO water and Nelson brothers delivered today.</p>

<p>Add C3 to surge tank from 1 bolt to 7 bolts. Canwest delivered some propane.</p>

<p>Devin checked K206 dump valve. He mentioned its a little bit sticky. Need to check it on a shutdown.</p>

<p>Cycled methanol a couple of times, high chiller differential.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; in the &quot;Overflow, currently pumping 85m<sup>3</sup>/day. BS&amp;W stayed below 0.198%.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler a couple of times.</p>

<p>Skimmed charcoal amine filter, 2 jugs of oil came out.</p>

<p>Open K203. 202, 201 louvers a little bit. Open up amine trim cooler tarf a little bit.</p>

<p>Chris page deliver some oil for the overhead tanks.</p>

<p>Vermilion gas dropped around 12:45. Restarted at around 1600 hours. Set LY 101 ( V101 Inlet Sep Level overide) from 50 to 40%. Set LIC 101 from 34-28 to 35-30.</p>

<p>Alex/Core lab grab some monthly gas samples.</p>

<p>Taggart/Baker took treater water and oil samples, also took a sample of V-101 condy.</p>

<p>Batched 5gal of SRW-6990 to the treater as per request of Taggart, should help to clean up the back water.</p>
