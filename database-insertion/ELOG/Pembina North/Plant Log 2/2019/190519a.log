========================================
<p>Skimmed amine surge tank to skim tank. &nbsp;Lowered level in amine contactor to 70 from 80 and amine flash tank to 55 from 60 and re-skimmed surge tank.&nbsp; Lowered level in skim tank a couple times to underground.&nbsp; Amine looked fairly clean.&nbsp; Skimmed top 3 bolts to flare.</p>

<p>Pulled charcoal filter skim line apart to find blockage.&nbsp; Found 1/2 inch swaglok&nbsp;valve plugged.&nbsp; Installed 3/4 valve with 1/2 inch internal diameter.&nbsp; Shouldn&#39;t plug off again.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 on 1st stage scrubber level.&nbsp; Level rang in again when re-started.&nbsp; Checked scrubber and was empty.&nbsp; Adjusted high level shutdown.</p>

<p>Changed out amine bag filter.&nbsp; X2.&nbsp; Installed oil absorbing filters.</p>

<p>Turned on&nbsp;chemical pump for corrosion inhibitor for acid gas drain.</p>

<p>Put de-but reflux valve in auto at 40%.&nbsp; Refluxing approx 180m3/day.&nbsp; Wanting to put an increased load on reboiler.&nbsp; Trends look a whole lot better.</p>

<p>Increased amine tops temp controller to 25% from 23%.</p>

<p>Adjusted de-eth re-boiler multiple times to maintain a high reflux, but not pinning the meter.</p>

========================================
<p>Lost plant this AM. lost all the electric frives including the hot oil heater and glycol pumps ect. VFD&#39;s for all of them were tripped. Seemed like a power bump except lost half of gathering and inlets ESD&#39;d. Mode 1,2,3 status never flagged either.</p>

<p>Fired back up with no issues.</p>

<p>C3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; res gas valve cap&nbsp;jack skrew&nbsp;north side discharge came out and was venting. Shut down and called out Tyson. Running c3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; for the time being.</p>

<p>C3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; has excess shaft play between the compressor and motor on the coupler. Tyson and Brandon digging into it.</p>

<p>Set K-204 top and bottom louver temp from 30 to 25 degrees.</p>

<p>Set K-203 top and bottom louver temp from 50 to 30 degrees.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-205 to 775 RPM due to hi compressor oil temp.</p>

<p>Closed manual hot gas bypass valve on the chiller to help c3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; load up more.</p>

<p>Powered off the D-Link router in the closet to get the alarm banner working again on the ops computer.</p>

<p>RTD is not working on c3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; bearing temp. Kevin aware.</p>
