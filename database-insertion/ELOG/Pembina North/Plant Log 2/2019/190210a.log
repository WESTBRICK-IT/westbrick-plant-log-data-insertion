========================================
<p>C3 compressor down at shift change.&nbsp;Fired back up and lost it&nbsp;on No Lube Flow.&nbsp;X2. &nbsp;Building was pretty cold.&nbsp; Closed up 3 of the louvers on the ceiling, Blocked the side vent by the glycol reboiler, and plugged the gap in the window by the glycol recovery tanks.&nbsp; Building warmed up pretty good.&nbsp; Pulled tubing for lube oil and drained cold oil to a pail and reconnected.&nbsp; No issues since.</p>

<p>Lean oil down at shift change.&nbsp; Fired back up once plant leveled out from C3 issues.</p>

<p>Increased amine make-up from 10 to 15.&nbsp; Water level at 20%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Left a message with Ken C for&nbsp;amine make-up water from Nelson Bros.</p>

<p>Al with HVO hauled in a couple of loads of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Raised a couple tarps a few inches on the amine trim cooler and cracked open a louver.</p>

<p>Turned 2 speed fan to fast on the res gas cooler.&nbsp; Amine contactor temp up to 44.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Clean.</p>

<p>Kim with Obsidien put 27 m3&#39;s of oil in the WPNA line, trying to push in a pig.&nbsp; Got a slug of liquid come in.&nbsp; Tried to check pig trap, couldnt close the inlet valve, most likely from hydrate material.&nbsp; Was able to get WPNA flowing through PNA line.&nbsp; Methanol truck will be out tommorow at 8.</p>
