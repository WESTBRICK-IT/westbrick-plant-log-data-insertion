========================================
<p>&nbsp;Levi called from Cynthia and asked if we could take any oil.&nbsp; Said we can take only one for tonight due to overflow tank level.&nbsp; HVO hauled in a load of Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>Lowered front water level&nbsp;on the treater.&nbsp; Was closing around 4 bolts, now around 1.&nbsp; Might help with keeping BS&amp;W down.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Clean.</p>

<p>Recycling both pumps out of the overflow since 22:00.&nbsp; BS&amp;W holding around 0.53 at shift change.</p>

<p>V-101 slugging in liquid randomly througout the night.&nbsp; Lowered level control on gas off valve to 40% from 50%.</p>

========================================
<p>-Rob Thirsk hauled in Zeta water and emptied out secondary containments.</p>

<p>-Mark Spellrum pigged wpne line, pig has been pulled.</p>

<p>-Drained oil out of Chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>-Lost k206 3 times on high scrubber level, also lost k208 and AC3&nbsp;compressors when 206 went down.</p>

<p>-Liquid slugging into V-101 compressor, we think this is what is causing the carry over to compression even though the level in the sep was not extreamly high.</p>

<p>-K-104 Compressor suction scrubber was also filling up and had to drain it several times.</p>

<p>-Adjust V-101 oil dump to open at 30% for 35% and close at 25% from 30%</p>

<p>-Recycle with both pumps out of the overflow tank all day trying to get the level down.</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in 1 load of Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>-Blew down V-101 Level colume to prove the level and it looked good.</p>

<p>-Flare ko filling up with the liquids dumped from compression, pumping out and still at shift change.</p>

<p>-Finished weekend checks</p>

<p>-Turned on the 2 speed c3 fan to fast.</p>

<p>-Cleaning crew out to clean the control rooms.</p>
