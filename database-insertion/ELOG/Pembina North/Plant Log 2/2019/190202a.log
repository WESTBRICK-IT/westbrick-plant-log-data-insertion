========================================
<p>K-204 top, inside louvers were hung up. Pull down on the actuator stem to pinch the louvers fully to increase cooler temp.</p>

<p>Slowed down de bute overhead fans from 10% to 0% to raise de bute pressure.</p>

<p>LCOS offloaded some yellow jacket on top of the hill for Vermilion tie in.</p>

<p>GGT hauled in two loads of Cynthia oil. Unsure if they will call to haul more.</p>

<p>V-101 level started acting funny. Blew down capilaries. All good.</p>

<p>Kevin T out to look into 5125 acid gas cooler issues. Turns out the hand switch was the culprit. Back online.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>V-103 gas meter flat lined. Kyle reset.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-203 to increase inlet temp to contactor.</p>

<p>Lost K-202. Lubricator no flow was the first alarm. Fired back up. Lubricator seems to be functioning normal. Lubricator light flashed every 50 seconds. Shutdown is after 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Rob T with GGT hauling in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>Snow removal around plant site.</p>

<p>TIC-5800 4th stage intercooler temp on the acid gas raised from 33 to 35 degrees.</p>
