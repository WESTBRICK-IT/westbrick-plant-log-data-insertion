========================================
<p>&nbsp;Starting plant up after turnaround.</p>

<p>- C3A issues, 2nd cylinder discharge leaking on the cap.&nbsp; Also found flare valves passing.&nbsp; Started C3B.</p>

<p>- Found De-eth liquids dump blocked in and reflux pump discharge back to&nbsp;reflux inlet&nbsp;bocked in.&nbsp; Opened both.&nbsp; Mike Marchand also looked at the dump valve off the de-eth and adjusted the travel on it.&nbsp; May need further inspection.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Opened&nbsp;up level transmitter for debut.</p>

<p>- C3B down on scrubber level.&nbsp; Full of propane.&nbsp; Tried pumping back to accumulator, but wouldn&#39;t go.&nbsp; Pumped to chiller with no issues.&nbsp; Restarted no issues.</p>

<p>- Set up glycol seperator dump for glycol to regen.&nbsp; Had to add a lot of glycol to finally get returns.&nbsp; Suspect that we didn&#39;t have enough gas volumes to sweep the glycol through.</p>

<p>- Set up dump for glycol flash tank.&nbsp; Found it was unable to dump to the top of the regen tower off the dump valve.&nbsp; Opened up&nbsp;inlet to bottom of regen and dumps fine.&nbsp; Must be an obstruction going to the top.</p>

<p>- Glycol sock filters filled with air.&nbsp; Bleed off on top and off sample point on discharge.</p>

<p>- Started recycle pump A.&nbsp; Opened line to fill boot.&nbsp; Found gas venting off the production tank.&nbsp; Dayshift please verity no more venting.</p>

<p>- Mike M blew down the level indication for the chiller.&nbsp; Was bouncing all over the place.&nbsp; Something was plugged in one of the sensing lines.&nbsp; All good now.&nbsp; Got level control for chiller in manual at 50%.</p>

<p>- No level showing in debut reflux.&nbsp; Dayshift can you get instrumentation to look at.</p>

<p>- Opened drains on cyclone seperator and inlet coalescer.</p>

<p>- Turned hot oil heater to auto and set to 190 degrees.</p>

<p>- Shut down K-201 and slowed down K-203 due to lack of gas.&nbsp; Also helped with getting De-eth pressure up and reducing the recycle on the C3 res gas.</p>

<p>- Set de-but bottoms temp to 80 later in shift.&nbsp; Still no level in reflux accumulator.&nbsp; Get instrumentation to verify level indication.&nbsp; Also the non VFD fan for the condensor off the de-but is not working.</p>

<p>- De-but releiving to flare quit a bit.&nbsp; Verify the low pressure by pass on the condensor is not wide open.&nbsp; And the louvers are wide open.&nbsp; Increased De-eth bottoms temp to 90 degrees.</p>

<p>- Started up one of the fans on the bulk cooler.&nbsp; Could not get the VFD to start.</p>

<p>- Blew down glycol nozzels to flare.&nbsp; Flows bouncing around.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Tri-Energy on site doing clean up and finished the perimeter blinds.</p>

<p>-Tri-energy removed the heat exchanger at the treater to be repaired</p>

<p>-Superior propane delivered c3</p>

<p>-Added c3 to the system.</p>

<p>-The flare valve on the south side of the c3 was replaced.</p>

<p>-Kevin Tonne got the de-bute cooling fan running.</p>

<p>-Started AC3 compressor</p>

<p>-Increased de-eth bottoms temp</p>

<p>-K205 is in sales.</p>

<p>-K204 is in hp mode.</p>

<p>-Installed the old psv off the water plant charge pump P2&nbsp;onto P1&nbsp;pump, we cant run P1 until the psv comes back but we can run the booster pumps to get rid of water.</p>

<p>-Polard on site insulating.</p>
