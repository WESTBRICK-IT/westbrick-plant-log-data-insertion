========================================
<p>Adjusted fan temps to 35 degrees on trim cooler, closed louvers.</p>

<p>Added oil to the LPG pump</p>

<p>Shut down Acid gas aftercooler.&nbsp; by hitting stop in the DCS.</p>

<p>shut off one c3 condenser fan and started the 2 speed on slow.</p>

<p>Level dropped a bolt on the volcano surge tank, walked lines and found nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>V-101 level controller acting up all night</p>

<p>Pinched K-203 louvers and K-202 louvers</p>

<p>Methanolled inlet once to try and get glycol returns</p>

<p>reduced de eth bottoms temp to 97 from 101, due to tops temps coming up.</p>

<p>Gas flow dropped off by about 100e3m3 over night on our inlets.</p>

<p>Lost lean oil pump due to low accumulator level at shift change.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped de eth temps down to 87 degrees</p>

========================================
<p>Plant upset. Ambient temp causing lots of issues.</p>

<p>V-101 dump line hydrated off at the ball valve outside of the building. Pumped methanol and dumped hot water on the line to get flowing.</p>

<p>Lost c3 compressor on hi scrubber level. Hot gas bypass was opened up around 40% or so causing propane to flash off and carry over to scrubber. Opened up manual hot gas valve to chiller gas off instead to prevent carry over to scrubber. (Back to normal now).</p>

<p>Inlet gas flows were all over the place. Down to as low as 300 ish e3m3. Glycol hanging up due to this and amine and ascid gas temps swinging.</p>

<p>Adjusted fan speeds and setpoints abit on the trim cooler. Trying to keep the recirc temp up.</p>

<p>Shutdown K-205 and swapped K-204 into sales. LOTO of K-205, drained engine and compressor oil and glycol and blinded the unit for tomorrows upcoming overhaul.</p>

<p>Turned off the west de bute overhead cooler fan to increase de bute pressure.</p>

<p>Lowered the de eth bottoms temp at start of shift to get more product over to the de bute. Slowly bringing it back up currently.</p>

<p>Fired the lean oil back up. Currently flowing 130 m3/day. Accumulator level is not quite accurate to the sight glass. Will fix tomorrow once we get a baker pump that works.</p>

<p>Glen with GGT hauled in 2 loads of Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 2 loads of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>V-101 level transmitter is giving us issues. Having to blow it down every hour, sometimes more. Called Vermilion and talked to Terrence (780-621-1072.) He got a pressure truck out and was batching methanol and cranked up his methanol pump rates for the cold snap.</p>

<p>Called Kevin down from Braz to lend a hand. Thanks Kevin.</p>
