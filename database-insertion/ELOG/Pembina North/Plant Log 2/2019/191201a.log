========================================
<p>Sampled all the inlets due to Bigoray sour issues. All sampled sweet except 14-03. Got 10 ppm off pig trap. Started flowing all Pem North inlets to Bigoray except 14-03 and they had no issues the rest of the night. Only Westbrick production is flowing down the 14-03 line. Vermilion production is shut in. Westbrick operator plans to shut in the plunger well that according to them only has &#39;&#39;trace&#39;&#39; sour. Will have to have discusion around brining their production on or leaving it down.</p>

<p>Filled up all the Herman Nelson heaters.</p>

<p>K-204 cooler temps were quite cold. Internal recycle and top louvers both open. Climbed up and closed the top louvers. Temps climbed up approx 7-10 degrees. Top louvers want to creep open still from worn linkage. May need to get instrumentation out to work on today if it stays cold.</p>

<p>Added pressure to amine contactor to ensure.</p>

<p>Blew down inlet coalescer, horizontal coaleascer, cyclone seperator, fuel gas scrubbers etc.</p>

<p>All producers flowed steady.</p>

<p>Plant steady.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in two loads of Baccalieu.</p>

<p>KPA delivered inhibitied methanol for splitter injection.</p>

<p>Spartan controls out for burner tuning on the Volcano.</p>

<p>Told Derick with Westbrick to shut in any wells with trace sour due to souring up Bigoray yesterday.&nbsp; Starting squeaking them in at 20 e3m3.&nbsp; Test multiple times throughout the day and still getting 7 PPM on the inlet.&nbsp; Won&#39;t increase rate until PPM&#39;s come down.&nbsp; Tested splitter outlet to Bigoray a couple times and got Nil PPM&#39;s.</p>

<p>Lost K-203 on low jacket water level.&nbsp; No apperant leaks.&nbsp; Topped up and re-started.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 when K-203 went down on underspeed.&nbsp; Restarted with no issues.</p>

<p>Topped up diesel for herman nelson heaters.&nbsp; Bob cat and tidy tank are full for nightshift.</p>

<p>Cracked opened K-203 discharge to process to help pressure up the contactor.&nbsp; Down to 800 KPA.&nbsp; Amine level was starting to rise due to not having enough pressure to dump.</p>
