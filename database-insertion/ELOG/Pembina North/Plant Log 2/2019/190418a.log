========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Oil sales shut in to Pembina on high BS&amp;W, swung both recycle pumps into the production tank for most of the morning plus we pumped a pail of demulsifier into the treater via the pump and another pail into the the overflow tank with HVO Trucking while unloading Baccaleau oil.</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in 1 load of Baccaleau oil from 16-18-48-12</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in 1 load of Baccaleau oil from 4-28-49-11 and 2 loads from 6-12-48-12</p>

<p>-Tri Energy worked on setting up scaffolding</p>

<p>-Devin worked on k-205 panel</p>

<p>-Hvo hauled in 1 load of Cynthia oil</p>

<p>-Pembina did their biocide batch</p>

<p>-Cleaned the recycle b meter and pot</p>

<p>-Changed a set of west water plant filters</p>

<p>-Still high on the BS&amp;W(.789) in the afternoon but pumping to Pembina. Pembina came out and did a cut and got approx .500 bs&amp;w</p>

<p>-Batched on 2 more pails of demulsifier into the treater and shut both recycle pumps off to give the chemical time to work on the pad and also a chance for the treater to warm up some. This was recommended by Tagart. Both pumps still off at shift change, night can start them once the treater is heated up.</p>

<p>-Called Cynthia and asked them not to ship any oil tonight until they call and get the okay by night shift because out overflow tank is quite high.</p>

<p>-Dumped 14 m3 of water off the treater front dump to the treater.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator oil.</p>
