<p>-Topped up LPG packing lubricators.</p>

<p>-Started K-201 to warm it up and make sure it starts ok, added coolant to it.</p>

<p>-V-101 slugging in hard throughout the day, blew down the capillaries a bunch of times, emptied K-204&#39;s suction scrubber once, called Terence with Vermillion and got him to up his methanol rates, he also batched methanol as well, started lining out around 14:40hrs.</p>

<p>-Changed the setpoint on V-101 dump back to 30%-25%.</p>

<p>-Added Meropa 220 to the amine charge pump.</p>

<p>-Put recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the &quot;Overflow&quot; line</p>

<p>-HVO (Shane) hauled in 3 loads of Baccalieu emulsion, 2 loads of 6-12-48-12W5, and 1 load of 13-16-49-11W5.</p>

<p>-Checked the polymer vent at 3-27 water injection well, when it was opened a little bit of produced water came out, checked the vent at the plant and there was nothing (vent may be frozen off) will keep checking daily, also will be making the polymer vent check a daily PM.</p>

<p>-Put in a workorder for V-101 high level switch not working,&nbsp; WO# 31958.</p>
