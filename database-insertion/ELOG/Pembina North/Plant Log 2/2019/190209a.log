========================================
<p>&nbsp;Apecs out with Brandon G for K-205 overhaul.&nbsp; Started commissioning it.</p>

<p>Apecs employee was dismounting the compressor felt something in his hip go pop when he stepped to the ground.&nbsp; Brandon was notified and he took him into the hospital.&nbsp; He also took statements from everyone and will be submitting a maximo event report.</p>

<p>Rob T hauled in two loads of water and condy from Zeta.</p>

<p>LCOS out with KPA pigging and de-watering the Vermilion pipeline.</p>

<p>Notified today by&nbsp;Kelly&nbsp;that possibly on tuesday, vermilion will be installing 2 argus valves and doing bakeouts on the line from the inlet on top of the hill and at the riser by TCPL.</p>

<p>Hot oil heater issues at start of shift.&nbsp; Temp down to 110 degrees.&nbsp; Shut in V-200 right away and went to help Gary start it.&nbsp; Kept going down on low flow.&nbsp; He recently changed the pumps over due to a mechanical seal failure.&nbsp; For some reason the west pump puts out 720 KPA and the east pump only puts out 680 KPA.</p>

<p>Work Ordered Mechanical seal for hot oil pump.</p>

<p>V-200 WPNA ESD frozen&nbsp;again.&nbsp; Romeo got it with the old Hot Water in a Pail trick.</p>

<p>Weekend and Montly checks.</p>
