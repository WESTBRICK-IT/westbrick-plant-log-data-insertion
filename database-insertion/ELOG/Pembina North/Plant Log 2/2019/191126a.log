<p>Topped up LPG lubricators.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivered amine makeup water.</p>

<p>Vermillion redirected gas to do some pigging at around 7:30AM, no flow to V-101/103 until around&nbsp; 9:00AM.</p>

<p>Shut down K-204 due to V-101 not flowing.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-203 from 880 to 750 when flows dropped.</p>

<p>Shut down the C3 two speed fan.</p>

<p>Nexsource doing H2S/LEL cals around the facility, also wired in the Volcano boiler glycol pump motor.</p>

<p>Tyson T. mounted the volcano glycol pump motor, also bled some pressure off of the suction dampener on the amine charge pump &quot;P-4750&quot;, seemed to help with the vibration issues. &quot;P-4750&quot; is now in service.</p>

<p>Lindale trucking hauled in a load of Baccalieu emulsion.</p>

<p>Maxxam out to prove the keylink autosampler.</p>

<p>Adjusted the Debut cooler AC-3102A speed from 50% to 20%.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 2 loads of Baccalieu emulsion, one more to come tonight.</p>

<p>Increased amine charge pump VFD control from 25% to 26% Flow is up to 201L/Min from 198L/Min.</p>

<p>Ryan worked on ADR.</p>
