<p>&nbsp;Rob T on site at&nbsp;start of shift&nbsp;pulling 10 m3 off the back of the treater.&nbsp; Transfered to south slop tank in the battery.</p>

<p>Taggart on site at start of shift, batched 2 pails of iron chelator to treater.&nbsp; Shut off recycle pumps after a few minutes, and left down so chemical could work its way through the treater slowly.</p>
