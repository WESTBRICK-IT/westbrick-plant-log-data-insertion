========================================
<p>Added oil to the LPG packing lubricators.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-208 1st stage suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Blew down chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>Set amine reboiler temperature TIC 4300 from 39 to 41, top temperature of V-4300 started dropping to 95 C.</p>

<p>Increased glycol reconcentrator temperature a little bit, reading 116 C.</p>

<p>Set V101 LIC 101 from 45-40 to 35-30. Blew down a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mechanics organizing around K206.</p>

<p>Darren changed water plant programming. When filter differential come up to 80 kPa, it will alarm. Then when it hit 100 kPa differential, it will alarm and shut-in the pumps. It won&#39;t open the bypass. We still have the option of manually opening it if we need to. Recommendation is to swap the filter before re-starting it and not opening the bypass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kyle checked water flash tank meter and found a chunk of rubber stuck in the turbune. Sampled treater water and talked to Taggart/Baker. Black stuff in the water chamber is the reaction of sour water mixing to sweet water.</p>

<p>Kevin T checked amine H2S sampler. Heat traced V101 separator.</p>

<p>Chris N. checked lean oil lubricator, will monitor this weekend.</p>

<p>Rob/GGT hauled in 2 loads of Zeta water.</p>
