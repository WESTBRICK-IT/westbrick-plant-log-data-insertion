========================================
<p>Lowered the glycol emission tank level&nbsp;abit.</p>

<p>Pembina tried kicking on again around 7:00 PM. Shut in on BS&amp;W. Swung both pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>Manually dumped out the cyclone sep and the inlet coalescer.</p>

<p>V-101 level transmitter started glitching out. Blew down level transmitter. Vermilion needs to get more methanol going down the line. And if their pumps are cranked up then install another one. Noticed&nbsp;some hydrate material again the last time i blew it down.</p>

<p>Dumped some methanol into the recycle pump batching tank to hopefully thaw it out enough to be able to batch chemical if needed.</p>

<p>V-107 seperator ESD on hi level. Set dump valve to dump at 25% and stop at 20%. It was 30% and 20% before.</p>

<p>Called Pembina around midnight. Got them to kick the pumps on after recycling with both pumps for about 5 hours. BS&amp;W was bouncing around but they kept the pumps going. Slowly trending down.</p>

<p>Lean oil pump went down at end of shift on &#39;&#39;analog shutdown&#39;&#39;. Cant seem to maintain a level in the accumulator. Inlet valve only opens up to 43% even in manual. #4 Packing also started leaking. Tightened up and got it to stop. Will have to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>-Topped up LPG lubricators.</p>

<p>-V-101 level issues this morning, called Terence with Vermillion, he batched some methanol around 8:30AM, started lining out around 10:00AM, blew it down a couple times this afternoon.</p>

<p>-Glycol level bouncing around, added a couple times from the overhead tank, lowered flash tank level control.</p>

<p>-Lean oil recycle valve packing was leaking, tightened it, all good.</p>

<p>-Hot oil heater down 1x on low flow, started back up, all good.</p>

<p>-Amine reflux high leveled, gave it a shot of antifoam, adjusted temperatures.</p>

<p>-Batched 5gal of DMO-46X to the treater, pembina shutting in on high BS&amp;W, morning sample from sales P/L was 0.2%, afternoon sample was 1.0%, both pumps in the production tank.</p>

<p>-Pulled WPNE pig, clean.</p>

<p>-Tightened packing on K-203 cylinder 4 volume pocket.</p>

<p>-Adjusted louvers on K-201 so they would close on the lower bank.</p>

<p>-Called HVO, notified them not to truck in any emulsion for the time being.</p>
