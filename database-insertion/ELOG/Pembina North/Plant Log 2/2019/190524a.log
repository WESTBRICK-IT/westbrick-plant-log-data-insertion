========================================
<p>Had a mystery flare. Found the flare valve on the recycle line cracked open half way. Flare got abit smaller.</p>

<p>Increased the temp setpoint on the top and bottom louver controller on K-204 from 20 to 25 degrees to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 on first stage scrubber level.</p>

<p>Blew down TR-101 front and back water sight glasses. Water quality has improved signifigantly.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water.</p>

<p>Added abit of pressure to V-200 pump. Barrier fluid is still maintaining.</p>

<p>Manaully dumped de eth overhead suction scrubber.</p>

<p>De eth reflux meter pinned and de eth tops temp started to warm up a few degrees. Cut back de eth bottoms temp from 86.5 degrees to 85 degrees.</p>

<p>K-202 speed governor started to creep up. Was running around 912 RPM. Cut back to around 895 RPM incase of overspeed shutdown.</p>
