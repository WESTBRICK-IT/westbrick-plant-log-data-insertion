========================================
<p>K204 leaking some gas from the 2nd stage suction cylinder inboard. Tyson changed out gasket. Found some more leaks coming from the flanges on the discharge side of cylinder 2. Will have it check on monday when it goes down for service.</p>

<p>Skimmed charcoal amine filter.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator oil.</p>

<p>Water plant will go don on sequence fail if we have only the booster running. Just restarting the pump when the pressure goes down.</p>

========================================
<p>HVO-hauling in 6-12 &amp; 6-16 Baccuilieau oil, AL &amp; Giovanni</p>

<p>Water well tubing pressure increasing, pump going down on high discharge press will continue to pump best we can.</p>

<p>Not to take any 3rd party produced water until well is fixed, HVO is aware of the issue &amp; will try there best not to bring too much water</p>

<p>Changed amine bag filter</p>

<p>Turned down amine pump rate from 15 to 8</p>

<p><u>Vermillion</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>9-16 gas flow yday 4.7 dec&#39;s &amp; oil was 52 m3</li>
	<li>16-02 will be on tommorow Talked to Martin @ 780-723-1564 he will be starting at 10:00 am</li>
	<li>V101 had slugging all day, up &amp; down extreme pressures &amp; flows, talked to Pat 780-898-5681 he was going to put acouple cubes of methenal in the line, once he did it all leveled out, still causing V200 pump trouble &amp; V3101 oil dump to esd on high pressure. Lost K206 on high scrubber liquids 2 x, &amp; blew down K204 scrubber 2 x,</li>
	<li>Really cold gas coming in on V101, at some points thru the day it was at -14*C on FQI99 &amp; -4 on FQI3008, also caused treater to cool quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>After alot of hydrate issues with V101 meteres, lost the compessors K206, K203 &amp; K3301A, we pressured up in the front of the plant, increased glycol rate from 10.5 to 14 m3 day flow, pressure dropped back to normal plant running better after Vermillion got methenal in there line to V101.</p>

<p>Worked on some loto for shut down</p>
