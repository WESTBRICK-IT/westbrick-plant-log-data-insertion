========================================
<p>Rob with GGT hauled Braz water.</p>

<p>Flaring acid gas from bypass around 4th stage releif to flare control valve on K-5000 compressor. Got 1/2 turn out of the valve. Seemed to help. Decicded to open valve and blow gas through it for awhile incase there was foreign material. Closed back up and chained valve close to prevent it from possibly opening from vibration. Closed 5050 makeup valve and the flare looks small and orange. Shot temps upstream and downstream of the valve and there is no tempature differential. Will monitor.</p>

<p>Nexsource electritians relamping sales compressor building.</p>

<p>Perry batched 5-14 pipeline.</p>

<p>Increased temp on the volcano boiler from 70 to 80 degrees.</p>

<p>HVO hauled&nbsp;3 loads of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Obsidian batched 11-22 well.</p>

<p>K-203 engine service.</p>

<p>Swung K-204 discharge to E-3101 exchanger. Compressor discharge climbed up to 6000 KPA, shut compressor down. Believe it hydrated again&nbsp;above the horizontal coalescer where there is no insulation. Heat trace is on, wrapped up all the piping.</p>

<p>Core Labs out to take weekly samples.</p>
