========================================
<p>Tried firing up the lean oil pump but it was shutting down on hi discharge pressure. Had to pump backwards through the discharge line from the exchanger with methanol. Fired back up. All good.</p>

<p>Lost c3 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; on hi suction scrubber level. The level control valve on the chiller over shot itself and the level got to 37% on the chiller when the valve started to cut back but it was too late and carried c3 over to the scrubber. Pumped out liquids and fired back up.</p>

<p>Had the 2 speed condencer&nbsp;fan on slow but had to turn it to fast later as it got pretty cold out.</p>

<p>Sped up the de bute cooler fan speed to 5%.</p>

<p>Slowly increasing the de eth bottoms temp to keep on spec while loading the lean oil.</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-202 and K-203 to warm up the inlet gas temp to the amine contactor.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 compressor on hi first stage discharge temp. Shot the valves after it was down all suction valves were 54 degrees. Discharge outboard around 90 degrees and discharge inboard around 120 degrees. I believe valves need to be changed.</p>

<p>Fired up K-208 to replace K-202.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 shortly after firing up.&nbsp;Was standing beside the panel when it happened. Heard air hissing at the panel and was waching when it went down.&nbsp;The only thing that flagged in was&nbsp;&#39;&#39;low cooling water pressure&#39;&#39;. But that was after it went down. Fired back up. All good.</p>

<p>Seem to be condencing lots of liquids on Both K-202 and K-208 4th stage suction scrubber causing it to dump lots and pressure up the boot&nbsp;and relieve to flare&nbsp;every so often. Pinched louvers to help prevent so much condencing. Helped abit.</p>

<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the production tank as the overflow tank rang in on low level.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT hauled in two loads of Zeta water.</p>

<p>Lean oil is now fully loaded and we are on spec. Can probably cut back the de eth bottoms as needed.</p>

========================================
<p>-Tyson and Brandon did the service on k202 and they also&nbsp;repaired the bad valves on cyl 1 inboard discharge. Shut down k208</p>

<p>-Caproco out&nbsp;to change out corrosion coupons in the plant and in the field.</p>

<p>-Pembina and Kpa did their monthly biocide injection</p>

<p>-Opened up louvers on K202 and k203 compressors.</p>

<p>-Tyson changed out the oil in the south lpg pump to AROX EP150 Mobil oil. There is 2, 5 gallon pails and a pump to fill with. This is to see if it will help with packing issues.</p>

<p>-Hvo delivered 1 load of Baccaleau emulsion from 6-16-49-11</p>

<p>-Rob Thirsk haul in produced water from Zeta and Braz.</p>

<p>-Started the 2 speed c3 fan to slow.</p>

<p>-Added c3 from storage.</p>
