<p>Closed louvers of K201, 202,203,208. Switch C3 fan from fast to slow.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator.</p>

<p>Drain K204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Adjusted TIC 3111 ( debut overhead cooler) from 100 to 80.</p>

<p>Dallas/HVO hauled in 1 load each from Baccalieu 3-16-47-11 and Velvet 4-34-49-12.</p>

<p>Eric/HVO hauled in 1 load from Baccalieu 1-19-49-11.</p>

<p>Took glycol concentration, lean-73.3%, rich-63.8%, tank 132-43%. Added twice from the reclamation tank.</p>

<p>Cycled methanol twice, not getting glycol return and showing high diff in the chiller. Glycol concentration on the rich side is down to around 52%.</p>

<p>Set glycol rate from 5 ( 9.89 M3/day) to 6.5 ( 12 M3.day). Added glycol from the overhead tank a couple of times (21.5&quot; to 20&quot;). Last concentration sampled at 4:25 AM, lean- 75.2%, rich -66.7%, tank-38%.</p>

<p>Set de-ethanizer bottom temperature from 97 to 100.</p>

<p>Sent work order to upgrade computer by the battery so we can see the same information into Window viewer.</p>
