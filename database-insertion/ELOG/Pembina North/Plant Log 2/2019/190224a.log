========================================
<p>Recycle &quot;B&quot; keeps going down, cleaned basket. Also found some ice plugged in the meter. Insulated and see lster if it will run.</p>

<p>Glycol level drops down, swapped out filter pot. Added some glycol but level still dropping. Changed out south glycol filter.</p>

<p>Cleaned up treater basket, some black stuff in there.</p>

<p>Flare knockout tank gaining some level. Pump not working, venting gas through and will not stroke up.</p>

<p>Vermilion V101 drops pressure around 2AM. Called Pat and he got an electrician to bring some battery for one of their RTU that supply fuel gas for the new well. Changed inlet setpoint from 1550 to 1200 kPa. Slowed down K204.</p>
