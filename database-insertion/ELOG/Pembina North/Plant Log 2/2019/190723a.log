========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Topped up LPG pump packing lubricators.</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, clean.</p>

<p>-Devin N. worked on K-203&#39;s Kenco, shut K-203 down once so he could do some verifications.</p>

<p>-Vermillion shut in some of their wells to clean sand traps around 08:00AM, approx 180e3m3 flow cut until 09:00AM.</p>

<p>-Blew down the chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>-Added oil to the lean oil pump day tank.</p>

<p>-Adam (HVO) hauled in a load of 3-28 emulsion.</p>

<p>-Ryan (HVO) hauled in a load of 6-12 Baccalieu emulsion.</p>

<p>-Rob (GGT) hauled in braz and zeta produced water, also sucked out the lean oil packing drain tank and the chiller deoiler.</p>

<p>-Cleaned air prefilters on the Hot oil heater.</p>

<p>-Cleaned air prefilters on the sullair compressor.</p>

<p>-Increased the temperature setpoint on the amine trim cooler to 43 from 35 to keep the amine at a higher temperature than the inlet gas to the contactor.</p>

<p>-Backfilled the hydrovac hole at the flare stack guidewire.</p>

<p>-Changed the rich amine bag filter.</p>

<p>-Changed water plant filters &quot;East Pot&quot;, west pot is now in service.</p>
