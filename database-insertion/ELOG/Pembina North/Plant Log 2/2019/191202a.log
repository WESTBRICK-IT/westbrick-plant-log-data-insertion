<p>Submitted MITS report on the sour production sent to Bigoray.</p>

<p>Closed K-203 discharge valve to the contactor to stop adding pressure as the contactor got up to 4600 KPA.</p>

<p>Diesel tank is empty after filling everything up. Diesel will have to be ordered today.</p>

<p>Herman Neslon heater at K-202 is not working properly. Fan will not engage and the heater trips on hi tempature.</p>
