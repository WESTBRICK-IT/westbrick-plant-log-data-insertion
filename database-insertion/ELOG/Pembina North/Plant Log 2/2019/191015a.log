========================================
<p>&nbsp;Core Labs out for weekly samples.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 3 loads of oil.</p>

<p>GGT (Rob) hauled in Braz water.</p>

<p>Changed out water plant filters on west pot.</p>

<p>Increased amine reboiler tops temp controler to 37% from 35% to help increase reflux.</p>

<p>K-104 down at Braz, started K-201 to help pull down pressures.</p>

<p>Cleaned up soaker pads around compressors.</p>

<p>Found leak on K-203 panel.&nbsp; Fitting was just hand tight.&nbsp; Tightened, all good.</p>

<p>Devin checked out damaged louvers on amine trim cooler.&nbsp; Evaluating options.</p>

<p>Lowered tarps on amine trim cooler and drained the water that was accumulating.</p>

<p>Pinched manual louvers on the acid gas compressor since temps have dropped.</p>

<p>Started overhead heaters in process and set for 25 degrees.</p>

<p>Checked heat trace around process and amine skid.&nbsp; Everything seems fine.</p>
