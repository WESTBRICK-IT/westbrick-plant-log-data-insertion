========================================
<p>&nbsp;Apecs and Chris N out to commission K-205 after overhaul.&nbsp; Back on Line.&nbsp; Shut down K-204 and swapped back over to V-101 mode.</p>

<p>K-204 pressuring up on discharge.&nbsp; After testing pressures along pipeline up to process.&nbsp; Found it was plugged right before it tied in with the horizontal coalecser outlet.&nbsp; Tried pouring hot water on exposed pipe.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Hooked up methanol baker pump and after lots of pumping it finally broke loose.&nbsp; Most likely formed an ice plug from being out of sevice for a week due to K-205 overhaul.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros hauled out process water.</p>

<p>Devin N calibrated H2S analyzers.</p>

<p>Core Labs out taking weekly samples.</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-203 a touch.</p>

<p>KPA out to inject methanol in WPNA inlet to break up hydrate in pig trap and ice plug in front of ESD valve.&nbsp; Had to pour hot water over ESD to get it to loosen.&nbsp; All good now.</p>

<p>Spectra Solutions out to do Vibration check and PDMA on C3A compressor.</p>

<p>Darkai out to service valves on new vermilion pipeline.</p>

<p>LCOS out to landscape around vermilion riser.</p>
