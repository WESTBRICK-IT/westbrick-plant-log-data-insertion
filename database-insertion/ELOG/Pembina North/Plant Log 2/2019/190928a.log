<p>GC Trouble rang in but no alarm displayed on panel.</p>

<p>Checked glycol concentration: 9:10 AM - L-85.4;R-81.1. Adjusted rate from 6.0 ( 11.17 M3/day) to 5.0 (9.15M3/day). Concentration at 1600 hours: L-84.6;R-78.1.</p>

<p>Started weekend check.</p>

<p>Started volcano, wouldn&#39;t stay running. Kevin and Mike Leteta were out and found high fuel gas pressure shutdown was set at 6&quot;WC instead of 18 3/4&quot;WC. Sent WO for it and recalibrating other shutdown, WO#34112, Volcano is operational.</p>

<p>Kyle pumped out flare knock out, recycled from the boot while pumping it out.</p>

<p>Checked for glycol leaks a few times after starting up the volcano, found some leaking fittings in the flare knockout building, tightened them.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; down, pulled basket and cleaned it.</p>

<p>HVO hauling in 4 loads of Baccalieu emulsion, one more load to arrive for nightshift.</p>

<p>Added barrier fluid to V-200 pump.</p>
