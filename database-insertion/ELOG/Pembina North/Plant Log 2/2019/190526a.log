========================================
<p>Kenny and Perry working on getting 14-03 pig unstuck. Blocked in at Pem North, depressured the line in the field got the pig to go backwards. Opened up around 22:00 PM and started flowing. Pig got stuck again approx 1/2 hour later. They will be out again today to work on it.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on under speed. Speed governor setpoint was set too high (800 KPA) so governor was calling for 0% while gas flows were down abit and shut compressor down. Had a hard time starting due to long crank alarm. Speed governor setpoint changed to around 700 KPA. Stayed running.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 and K-203. Res gas recycle was opened 70%.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-202 abit due to flows being down.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204 so K-206 would take more gas from V-101 due to V-3101 flows being down.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 on low suction pressure after K-206 went down. Fired back up.</p>

<p>LPG pump plunger pump sampler blowing out gas again. Blocked in plunger pump. Will have to get Devin to look at it.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; went down. Cleaned screen and restarted.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Manually dumped TR-101 back water from 5 to 2 bolts.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump lubricators.</p>

<p>Hot gas bypass control valve was opened 33%. Opened up manual hot gas bypass valve 100% to prevent possible carry over to suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Slowed down de bute overhead fans to 50% from 70%.</p>
