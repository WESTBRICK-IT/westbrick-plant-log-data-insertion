<p>-Water plant to well balance was out again today, checked both polymer vents and also walked the pipeline from the plant to well, found no signs of a line break, monitored the flow meter at the well and at the plant, it seems that when the booster pumps are running the flow meter at the well isn&#39;t populating, but when the disposal pump is running it is populating, notified Kelly S.</p>

<p>-At 1:00PM checked the flow at the water well compared to the water plant, 242.5m<sup>3</sup>/day at the well, 245.6m<sup>3</sup>/day at the plant. 6096KPA on the tubing, nothing out of polymer vent.</p>

<p>-At 4:00PM, water well flow was 237m<sup>3</sup>/day, water plant was 244m<sup>3</sup>/day. 8539KPA on the tubing, nothing out of polymer vent.</p>
