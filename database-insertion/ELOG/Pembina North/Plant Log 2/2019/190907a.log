========================================
<p>Filled up lean oil lubricator tank with the rest of the Aries 150 oil. Will&nbsp;need to bring a new drum into building.</p>

<p>Changed water plant filters.</p>

<p>Res gas recycle valve was closed, Pressure was around 1900 KPA. Sped up K-201. Went down shortly after on underspeed. Did not want to hold steady RPM. Cycled the RPM with the governor linkage a bunch and it eventually started to control steady. Thinking maybe the regulator for the actuator on the governor was sticking. Left compressor running around 900 RPM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Marty hauled in a load of produced water.</p>
