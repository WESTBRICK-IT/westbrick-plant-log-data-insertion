<p>Weekend and Monthly checks.</p>

<p>Drained lube oils off bottom of chiller.</p>

<p>Getting lots of liquids (lean oil)&nbsp;condensed out by the bulk cooler and dumping to the amine skim tank through the horizontal coalescer.&nbsp; This is contaminating any amine in the skim tank.&nbsp; Drained skim tank empty to flare.&nbsp; Will check level tommrow to gauge how much were getting, and if needed, bypass coaleser and block in.</p>
