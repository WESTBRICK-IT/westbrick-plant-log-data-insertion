========================================
<p>Helped dayshift level plant out after going sour.</p>

<p>Level in reboiler down to 30%.&nbsp; Lowered level in amine contactor to 50% from 55% and reflux accumulator to 45 from 50%.&nbsp; Also added from overhead tank and increased amine make-up water to 15% from 10%.</p>

<p>E-3101 differential up to 2500 KPA.&nbsp; Added methanol and started glycol pumps.&nbsp; Blockage let loose quickly.&nbsp; Back to Normal.</p>

<p>Found HP to MP let down valve failed open in the Annex, causeing K-206 to recycle and reducing plant gas flow.&nbsp; Closed.&nbsp; Work Ordered.</p>

<p>Called Nelson Bros and ordered amine make-up water for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor S/D.&nbsp; Would not restart.&nbsp; Called out Devin and found that high casing pressure was the culprit.&nbsp; Found that weird as the S/D is set for 12000 KPA and has multiple times gone above that in recents months.&nbsp; Will follow up with Daren.</p>

<p>Bleed approx a gallon of diesel off the casing and got the pressure down to 11750 KPA and restarted acid gas compressor.</p>

<p>Lost K-208 on 1st stage pressure.&nbsp; Restarted with no issues.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in one load of Baccalieu.</p>
