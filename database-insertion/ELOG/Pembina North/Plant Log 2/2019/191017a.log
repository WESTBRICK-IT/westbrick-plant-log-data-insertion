========================================
<p>Added nitorgen to V-200 pump.</p>

<p>After Braz K-104 fired up gas flows dropped at Pem. De eth reflux meter was pinned. Dropped the de eth bottoms temp from 94 to 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Slowed down the de bute overhead fan speed to 65% to maintain pressure on de bute.</p>

<p>Amine regen tops temp climbed up after gas flows dropped and started to reflux hard. Pinched the temp control valve by 1%.</p>

<p>V-3106 LEL head rang in and reading went back to zero within a minute or so. Went out with the 4 head monitor and couldnt find anything.</p>

<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>Monitored TR-101 flange gasket. All good.</p>
