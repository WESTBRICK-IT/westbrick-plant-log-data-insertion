========================================
<p>Topped up LPG pump packing lubricators.</p>

<p>Apecs out to tear in to K-205 engine and compressor.</p>

<p>Devin repaired the glycol baker pump and worked on the lean oil level transmitter. The sight glass is approx 50% and the level transmitter is saying 65&amp; but the level is maintaining. He will continue to look into it.</p>

<p>Crews up on the hill for Vermilion riser tie in.</p>

<p>Lost battery comms this am. Mike, Kevin and Kristina working on it. Ended up being a faulty fiber optic line. They are now utalizing the comms from the truck offload camera for the battery PLC comms for now.</p>

<p>WPNA pig trap is hydrated off. Isolated the trap inlet and outlet inside of the building and opened the trap up to the flare. Flare line also froze off. Flare line is heat traced, however there is no insulation. Wrapped the line with insulation snake. Wade with Obsidian is looking into getting a pressure truck out tomorrow.</p>

<p>Changed the filters at the battery water plant.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Alex with core labs out to take weekly samples.</p>
