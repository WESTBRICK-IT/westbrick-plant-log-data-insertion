<p>Lost K-202 on mystery alarm. K-202 ESD was the first alarm on the PLC. Fired back up and switched it from manual to auto.</p>

<p>Glycol level in the accumulator dropped off. Flash tank and glycol sep levels were good. Added a little glycol from overhead tank. Level continued to climb back and and maintained the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump packing lubricator.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Swept frost off of coolers a few times through the night.</p>

<p>Swept off coolers twice.</p>

<p>Lowered the level in the glycol seperator slightly.</p>

<p>Glycol was swinging through the night but level stayed above 40%.</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-202 and K-203 to increase inlet temp to the contactor.</p>

<p>Blew down front and back water sight glasses on TR-101.</p>

<p>Swept off the coolers twice due to frost.</p>

<p>Lowered the level in the glycol seperator slightly.</p>

<p>Glycol was swinging through the night but level stayed above 40%. Seemed to line out later in the shift.</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on K-202 and K-203 to increase inlet temp to the contactor.</p>

<p>Blew down front and back water sight glasses on TR-101.</p>

<p>14-03 pig came in around 20:00 pm.</p>

<p>Lean oil flow rate dropped off. Couldnt see any level in sight glass. Transmitter was saying 72%. Pumped up glycol leg and blew down sight glass ect. Slowly loaded the lean oil after lining out process. Flow rate currently at 130 m/day and de-eth bottoms at 95 degrees. Not quite making enough product yet&nbsp;to run the lean oil any faster</p>

<p>Lost K-202 compressor. First alarm was &#39;&#39;lube oil no flow shutdown&#39;&#39;. Fired back up and lubricator was cycling fine. Assuming this was the first alarm to ring in after a mystery shutdown.</p>
