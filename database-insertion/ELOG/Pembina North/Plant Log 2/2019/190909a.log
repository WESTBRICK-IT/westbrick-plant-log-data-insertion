========================================
<p>De eth level and bottoms temp randomly started to swing aggressivly at start of shift. Tried controlling in manual but no luck. Bypassed reflux condencer to make less product and get levels under control. Helped a little bit but still&nbsp;swinging.&nbsp;Shut down the lean oil, lowered the de eth bottoms temp down to 80 degrees. Let it run for abit and got the levels under control. Slowly closed the bypass around the reflux condencer and started to make reflux again. Increased the bottoms temp on the de eth and slowly ramped the lean oil flow rate back up. Running steady now. Have the lean oil flow rate back up to 120 m/day&nbsp;and the de eth bottoms temp currently at 87 degrees. Will have to increase bottoms temp as needed.</p>

<p>Increased methanol pump&nbsp;flow rate to around 115 L/day on the de eth due to a possible hydrate issue.</p>

<p>Notified Rob with GGT of the low methanol tank level so he can bring some out.</p>

<p>HP cold dep sight glass not showing a level. Blew down. Level came back.</p>

<p>West water plant filters plugged off. Swung in to the East pot and it plugged off within 15 minutes. Did not have a chance to change the filters out on either pot.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator canister.</p>

<p>Zeta cameras went down. Will have to talk to Darren.</p>

<p>Changed out a couple sets of water plant filters.</p>

<p>Batched a pail of SRW 6990 into the production tank and prime tank.&nbsp; Blocked in feed from production to prime tank.&nbsp; Left production tank skimming to skim tank for the night.&nbsp; Filled up prime tank to skim line and left blocked in with SRW6990 chemical in it to help dissalve iron sulphides.&nbsp; Rob Thirsk will be out tomorrow with another load to pump into the prime tank and skim it also over to the prime tank and skim tank.&nbsp; Once he&#39;s done that, water plant can be put back into service.&nbsp; Pumps shut off.</p>

<p>NIGHT SHIFT, if HVO hauls in any oil tonight, please switch recycle into the production tank as we don&#39;t want any extra water being dumped to the water plant.</p>

<p>Set up Lean oil barrel and finished installing tap for filling day tank.&nbsp; Labeled container &quot;Aries 50&quot; for using to fill.</p>

<p>Filled lean oil day tank.</p>

<p>V-101 liquid level stuck at 29%.&nbsp; Dumping gas to treater.&nbsp; Blew down level transmitter and put back in service.</p>

<p>Core labs out for weekly samples.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk hauled in 3 loads of Zeta water.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu.</p>

<p>Ordered process water for Thursday from Nelson Bros.</p>

<p>Changed 3 sets of water plant filters.</p>

<p>Increased De-eth bottoms temp to 92 from 88 to help with Ethane spec.</p>
