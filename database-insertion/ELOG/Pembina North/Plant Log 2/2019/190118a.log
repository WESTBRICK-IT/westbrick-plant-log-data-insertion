========================================
<p>Cut some temp out of the de eth bottoms from 79 degrees to 75 degrees. Still maintaining spec.</p>

<p>Lowered the c3 accumulator pressure to&nbsp;890 kpa from 975 kpa to take some load off of the c3 compressor.</p>

<p>Shutdown the single speed fan on the c3 condencer and fired up&nbsp;the 2 speed fan on slow.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Swung both pumps into the production tank as the overflow level was low.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Filled up the LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>V-101 level transmitter glitched out but managed to start reading correctly again. Noticed it&nbsp;after on the trends. Will have to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Increased the level on the glycol seperator slightly as the glycol level was in the bottom of the sight glass.</p>

<p>Debute rang in high level around 04:30&nbsp;this am. Noticed there was no flow rate on LQ-3102 and the dump valve (LIC-3114) was 60% open. The valve only opens to a maximum of 60% when in auto. However, the debute level will not go down and cannot get a flow rate unless the valve is in&nbsp;manual at 65% or more. Verified that valve is cycling when in auto. Maybe just not opening far enough? Not sure if there was always a clamp on the valve or not? Currently running the valve in manual. WO#31708.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute fan speed from 15% to 0% hoping to help the debute dump. No luck. Back up to 10%.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;adjusted louver linkage on AC-3102a so they whould close</p>

<p>bypassed e3106 to try and warm up the debut line to the bullet, line was acting like there was a blockage</p>

<p>Daren removed the clamp from LIC3114, will now open 100%</p>

<p>Devin repaired leaking lube oil tubing line on k-205.</p>

<p>Kyle worked on PSV list</p>

<p>Keabray out to look at BC3 piping</p>

<p>Rob hauled Braz and Zeta H2O</p>

<p>HVO hauled in oil</p>

<p>opened louvers on K203</p>

<p>shut off debut fans</p>

<p>BC3 off line to change 2 outboard discharge valves on stage 1</p>

<p>lowered deeth temp and opened bypass around the deeth cond and blocked in cond inlet to try and take the load off the C3, also blocked in the hot gas make up on the chiller</p>

<p>added eg from the overhead and methanol to the front end</p>
