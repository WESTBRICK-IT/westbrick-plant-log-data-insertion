========================================
<p>&nbsp;Kristina calibrated water plant diff guage, reading much better now.</p>

<p>Vermilion added another about 125 e3m3 in gas.&nbsp;&nbsp; V-103 now in service.</p>

<p>RO water showed up, put pump at 20% from 16% to make up for it being down.</p>

<p>Turned off CO2 blend gas at 09:30 to make room for the new flows.</p>

<p>Increased glycol flow rate from 12.6 to 13m3/d due to increased gas flow.</p>

<p>Increased Amine flow rate on charge pump from 20% to 27%.&nbsp;&nbsp; started going sour due to increased flow rate.</p>

<p>Increased Amine reboiler temp from 34% to 39% to keep top temps up.</p>

<p>Increased Lean Amine trim cooler temp on the louvers from 36 to 41 degrees to keep a temp differential on the inlet gas to Amine tower.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 5 loads of Baccalieu, and 1 load of Mancal.</p>

<p>Keabray out to expose more risers at the plant.</p>

<p>Opened up K-202 louvers</p>

<p>Slug of fluid came in for about half an hour into V-3101 not sure why or where it came from.</p>

<p>V-101 high leveled once.</p>

<p>Glen and Rob came out to suck out the bad water from the Prime tank, flushed best we could and put back into normal service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Water coming back was clean.</p>

<p>Recycling out of each tank.</p>

<p>Fuses blew in the plc&nbsp;panel in the water plant this morning, Kristina repaired and water plant back up and running.</p>

<p>Carl dropped off some more water filters.</p>

<p>changed waterplant filters twice.</p>
