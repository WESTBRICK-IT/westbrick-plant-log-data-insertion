========================================
<p>Took an amine concentration around 11:00 AM. Concentraqtion is at 39.5%. Lowered amine makeup pump to 22 from 30%.</p>

<p>Gas flow swinging up and down. HP cold sep sight glass was not showing a level but seemed to be maintaining level decent. Decided to fill up the glycol leg. When draining it oil came out. Turns out the leg was filled up prior with the baker pump containing anit foam. Refilled leg with norcool and the level started to read accurate. HP cold sep was dumping gas causing all the issues.</p>

<p>Drained berms.</p>

<p>Bled down the WPNA pipeline for Wade due to his well being loaded up. Pipe line has differential. Leaving for the night. Wade will probably batch methanol tomorrow.</p>

<p>Adjusted de eth bottoms temp and debute overhead fans due to change in gas flow ect.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine reboiler to the flash tank.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Velvet and Cynthia oil.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>
