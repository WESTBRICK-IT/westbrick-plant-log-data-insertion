========================================
<p>HVO delivered a second load of Baccalieu oil after shift change.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Increased the de eth temp to 79 degrees to maintain spec.</p>

<p>When the de eth bottoms temp is around 80 degrees or&nbsp;higher and&nbsp;inlet gas flow increases&nbsp;the pressure on the de eth tower gets up to 2100 KPA. May need to keep the pressure lower to be able to increase bottoms temp to drive off more gas and start refluxing properly. Currently still increasing bottoms temp. Maybe it will be fine but may need to start K-201 to help out.</p>

<p>De eth reflux pump 3101 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; is still turned off.</p>

<p>Plant ran steady.</p>
