========================================
<p>Increasing the de eth bottoms temps to drive more off and get some liquids in the reflux accumulator. Bottoms temp set at&nbsp;80 degrees and slowly filling the acccumulator. Can probably cut the temp way back once refluxing starts. C3 compressor seems to be handling it ok.</p>

<p>Glycol level was slowly trending down. Lowered the level in the glycol sep abit. Level swinging. Trying to keep the level steady.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; into the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan on fast.</p>

<p>Water plant filters bypassed.</p>
