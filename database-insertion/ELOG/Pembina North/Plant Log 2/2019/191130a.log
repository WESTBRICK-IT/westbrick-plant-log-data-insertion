========================================
<p>Loaded up K-203 compressor and started discharging V-3101 production down EGG line to Bigoray. Approx 470 e3m3 total.</p>

<p>Called Vermilion and Westbrick operators to kick their wells back on. Westbrick production will come on in the AM.</p>

<p>Swung 1-21 production into V-3101.</p>

<p>Blocked in 5-14 at pig reciever.</p>

<p>Blew down inlet coalescer, horizontal coalescer, cyclone seperator, fuel gas scrubbers etc.</p>

<p>Hooked up Herman Nelson heater and spotted at the amine trim cooler incase of any loss of amine/regen circulation. Cycled heater to ensure it would work.</p>

<p>Got tarp hung over top of amine bulk cooler. Crew will finish getting it tarped in today and heaters can be kicked on to it.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubber as it rang in hi level. Verified that V-101/V-103 werent carrying liquids over.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Numerous walk throughs and looking over equitment.</p>

<p>Obsidian got shutdowns raised on 6-19 compressor so they can push into the higher line pressure.</p>

<p>Methanol is on and pumping down pipeline to Bigoray. Verified numerous times that the pump is flowing.</p>

<p>Keabray finished blinding c3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; compressor.</p>

<p>Compressors maintained around 3900 KPA discharge to Bigoray around 40 degrees. Warmer ambiant temps in the forecast should help.</p>

<p>Plant steady otherwise.</p>
