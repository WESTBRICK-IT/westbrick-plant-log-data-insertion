<p>Keabray out installing screens on door ways.</p>

<p>Brandon/Elite did meter calibration on V103 and V107.</p>

<p>Added a barrel of sun oil to the hot oil.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in Baccaleau oil.</p>

<p>Devin pulled out bypass control valve that was leaking at the water plant no longer need, blinded.</p>

<p>Hot oil went down while we are working at the water plant, unaware plant went sour, kicked out of sales, shut inlets, tried recycling thru K206, Daren had to find why the valve would not open, link in the DCS was not responding, got that open started recycling, then pulled back on sales till parts came down, reopened sales to sell again, amine was upset with amine to the acid gas comp, cleared liquids to acid gas got it going. All inlets BOL.. Assisted nightshift.</p>
