========================================
<p>Obsidian pigged PNA, and 1-21.</p>

<p>Keyera field ops pigged splitter and EGGS.&nbsp;&nbsp; All pigs came in good.</p>

<p>Rob hauled 4 loads of Zeta water.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG lubricator</p>

<p>Added pressure to V-200 pump seal</p>

<p>Added C3 to surge tank.</p>

<p>Acid gas well had a leaking grease nipple on the Well head wing valve, got Right way valve out to grease all valves on well head.&nbsp; Shut down Acid gas compressor so all valves can be opened and closed for nservicing.&nbsp; All good now.</p>

<p>ESD actuator at acid gas well was low on fluid and leaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Devin repaired but noticed gas coming out of the actuator vent while the latch was unsatisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notified supervisor and submitted a MITS.&nbsp; The tubing line from the downhole ESD was depressured while masked up.&nbsp; The line depressured so the leak from the sub ESD is a slow one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well is to be checked 2 times a day and the doors on the well are to remain closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify night shift of monitoring well.</p>

<p>Allan was out doing some welding and working on his list.</p>

<p>Put battey charger on the day shift truck as the batteries were dead.&nbsp; Parts are still not at GM for repairs.</p>
