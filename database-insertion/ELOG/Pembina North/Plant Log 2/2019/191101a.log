========================================
<p>Rob with GGT hauled in Braz and Zeta water. Also, sucked out the sullair drum.</p>

<p>Mark picked up the hot oil pump electric motor. Him and Tyson installed and coupled up to the pump.</p>

<p>Fired up P-3501 &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; hot oil pump and shut &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; down to ensure it was working. Lost the hot oil heater on low flow. Fired heater back up. Still running pump &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; just had to give the recycle valve time to open up. Pump &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; dosnt put out as much as &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;. Tyson will order parts then pull it appart and inspect the impellor. Both pumps are ok to run.</p>

<p>Opened up the amine regen tops temp controller 2% due to the temps dropping abit from switching to the &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; hot oil pump.</p>

<p>Tightened up the packing abit on the discharge valve for &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; hot oil pump as it has a slight drip. Keep an eye on the pump tonight please.</p>

<p>Kim with Obsidian shut in PNA and WPNA sour production into V-200. 1-21 sweet gas is the only thing going into V-200 at the moment.</p>

<p>Kristina changed the orfice palte on V-200 so the 1-21 flow would register.</p>

<p>Christian with Vermilion shut in the 2 sour wells on the 5-14 line this AM around 09:30.</p>

<p>Adjusted the de bute overhead fan speed as needed.</p>

<p>Went to slow down K-202 due to lower LP gas flows. Governor must have been sticky from being left in manual and the unit went down on underspeed. Wouldnt start due to the starter bendix being stuck. Got Tyson to fix. Fired back up and&nbsp;adjusted the governor controller so it would control in auto.</p>

<p>LP header pressure got really low after some of the LP production was shut in. Pressure was lower than it should have been. MP to LP let down valve was open 100%. Went down to inspect it and the ball valve downstream was half pinched. Opened back up and pressure went back to normal.</p>

<p>Contacted Mark Spelrem and notified him to pig the 14-03 line tomorrow because we cant take a pig until TR-101 is back online. He will call in the AM and let us know if he is sending or not.</p>

<p>A new alarm for the boot has been made for the TR-101 outage. The boot pressure will alarm at 20 KPA to give us warning if a dump sticks open and create excessive venting.</p>

<p>Stetson called and the parts have finally shown up for the dayshift truck. Will take it there Monday or Tuesday for repair.</p>

<p>MOC meeting for TR-101 bypass this AM.</p>
