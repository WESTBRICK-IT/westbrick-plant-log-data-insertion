========================================
<p>Changed amine bag filter.</p>

<p>Pembina started pumping at shift changed and pumped us down all night. BS&amp;W was hanging around .525%.</p>

<p>Blew down V-101 seperator level column a few times. Started getting lots of hydrate material. Called Vermilion operator and got him to cut one of his wells back by 70e3m3. Seemed to help. Also&nbsp;one of their methanol pumps was plugged off earlier.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan on slow to increase contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Glycol flash tank dump valve was stuck open. Dialed back the controller to get it to control.</p>

<p>Added a little oil to amine charge pump crank case.</p>

<p>Added a little bit of amine from the overhead tank to raise up the reboiler level abit as it dropped down to 21%. Increased the amine makeup water from 13 to 15%. We will need to order makeup water soon as the tank is currently around 35%.</p>

<p>14-03 rider ESD&#39;d. Notified Westbrick operator Lance Hartman. They were having generator issues. Back up and flowing around 01:30 AM.</p>

<p>Swung one pump into the overflow tank at 03:00 AM. Could get the next truck we recieve to suck some chemical on and offload it into the overflow and recycle it through if needed.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;issues with v-101 in the morning, Vermilion batched methanol</p>

<p>sampled oil off the treater 0% H2O, dumped down the front and back levels</p>

<p>increased press on the debut to get level to the lean oil</p>

<p>14-3 pig sent, V-3101 high level, pulled pig, clean.</p>

<p>K208 down on low suction when the pig was comming in, left down untill flows increased</p>

<p>changed EG filter</p>

<p>found valves on recycle B leaking to the batch tank, changed out valves and called Can vac to clean up small spill</p>

<p>GGT/ Rob delivered 80/20 glycol</p>

<p>Terrence with Vermilion increased his methanol injection from 180 to 300l/d</p>

<p>belt is off the west C3 fan, WO in</p>

<p>sampled oil&nbsp;off pembina pumps in the afternoon .2% H2O</p>

<p>tightened packing on recycle A, please monitor both recycle pumps for leaks.</p>
