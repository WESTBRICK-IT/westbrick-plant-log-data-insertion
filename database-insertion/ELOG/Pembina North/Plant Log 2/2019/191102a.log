========================================
<p>&nbsp;Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT hauled Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>Emptied the overflow tank and swung both recycle pumps into the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Mark sent the 14-03 pig. Lots of fluid.</p>

<p>Added oil to acid gas compressor crank case. Seems to be using more oil or the kenco isnt working properly. Will monitor.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth overhead suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>Called Pembina and asked if they could pump our tank down as much as they can. They will pump 50 more m3 and see if they are able to handle more after that. 780-400-4671.</p>
