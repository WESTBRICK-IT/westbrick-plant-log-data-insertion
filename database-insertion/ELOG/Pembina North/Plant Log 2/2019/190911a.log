========================================
<p>&nbsp;Changed water filters 6x, Rob will be out in the morning to suck out the Prime tank.</p>

<p>Closed ESD bypass on the water plant inlet to tank.&nbsp;&nbsp; ESD is satisfied.</p>

<p>Stream&nbsp;line inspections out doing&nbsp;UT on risers in the plant.</p>

<p>Summer drilling repaired and replaced pump and line in water well, all good now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Found small hole in&nbsp; the tubing&nbsp;6&quot; above the pump.</p>

<p>Did MOC and prepped for Vermillion split flow tomorrow into V-103.</p>

<p>Changed V-101 dump shut off to 28 from 25 to see if the level lines out better instead of dumping empty.</p>
