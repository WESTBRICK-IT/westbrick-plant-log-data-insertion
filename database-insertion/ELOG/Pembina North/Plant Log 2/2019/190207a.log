========================================
<p>&nbsp;Skimmed the Amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Apecs here working on K-205 overhaul until 21:30hrs.</p>

<p>LCOS here working on Vermillion tie in until 18:30hrs.</p>

<p>Changed out the filters on the east filter pot at the water plant, and put the west pot in service.</p>

<p>Raised the hot oil heater set-point from 222 degrees C to 225 degrees C. (still ringing in and out)</p>

<p>Lowered tarps on the trim cooler.</p>

<p>De-eth reflux accumulator giving me grief, would not dump, knocked down the lean oil. Added some methanol to the De-eth refux accumulator, blew down the lean oil sight glass. Lean oil back online.</p>

<p>Would be nice to have a larger alarm window for high temp on the hot oil heater, and for V-103 at Braz high diff pressure.</p>
