========================================
<p>V-101 lost flow around 10:30. Texted Terrence with Vermilion. He&nbsp;is having issues with his inlet controller. Shutdown K-204 until flows come back.</p>

<p>Lost acid gas compressor shortly after gas flows dropped off. No shutdowns rang in. Fired back up. Looked over compressor. All good.</p>

<p>Cut back amine reboiler control valve from 36% to 35% after flows dropped off as the tops temp was climbing and refluxing hard.</p>

<p>C3 accumulator rang in low pressure after V-101 flows dropped off. Shut down the West c3 condencer fan and fired up the East 2 speed fan on slow.</p>

<p>Pumped down the glycol reclimation tank.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil.</p>
