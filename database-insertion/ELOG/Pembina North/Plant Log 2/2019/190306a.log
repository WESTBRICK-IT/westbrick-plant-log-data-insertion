========================================
<p>Methanolled inlet 2x due to chiller diff increasing.</p>

<p>V-101 level control acting up several times through out the night.</p>

<p>Glycol bouncing around, pumped a small amount from the overhead tank.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-201, K-202, and K-203 due to weather cooling down.</p>

<p>7-11 ESD shut in on high pressure.&nbsp; Left down</p>

<p>K-208 down twice.&nbsp; Not sure why as no flags were up.</p>

========================================
<p>-Topped up LPG lubricators.</p>

<p>-Locked out H2O plant for 3-27 water injection well acid batching job.</p>

<p>-Wednesday morning meeting.</p>

<p>-V-101 issues this morning, blew down the level transmitter several times, called Terrance with Vermillion, he batched methanol this morning, started slugging in really hard around 9:30AM, carried some liquids over to K-204 suction scrubber, manually dumped the scrubber a few times, started lining out around 10:00AM. They installed another pump to increase their methanol injection.</p>

<p>-Devin N. worked on process and sales H2S anilyzer calibrations, also adjusted the dump valve on V-101 so that it fully opens.</p>

<p>-Tyson T. worked on fixing the leak on the East flare knockout pump.</p>

<p>-Called HVO, told them they can start trucking in emulsion, they won&#39;t be hauling in 6-12 Baccaleau.</p>

<p>Called Pembina to ship oil.</p>

<p>Barry/Vermilion called and re-started one well going to V107 this afternoon. Set V107 PIC 1076 from 1100 kPa to 900 kPa.</p>

<p>Glycol concentration still low at lean - 68.8%/ rich - 60.6%. Added some glycol into the accumulator. Changed out glycol roots from 7 to 8.5 (12.9 M3/day to 15.51 M3/day).</p>

<p>Cycled methanol once going into the gas to gas exchanger.</p>

<p>Open up K202, 201,203 louvers a little bit.</p>
