========================================
<p>&nbsp;Cleaned the treater heat exchanger basket, full.</p>

<p>Added glycol from the overhead, about 30% in the accumulator,&nbsp; Leveled out most of the night and started bouncing around at shifts end.</p>

<p>Sales gas parts are up from normal 2.3ppm, took samples at braz and found nothing.&nbsp; Get day shift to maybe look into this.</p>

========================================
<p>Rob T hauled in Braz and Zeta water.</p>

<p>Took an amine concentration. It is at 37%. Coming down slowly. Left pump at 15%. Will take another titration tomorrow and adjust pump as needed.</p>

<p>Glycol level bouncing around. Lowered the glycol seperator slightly.</p>

<p>Blew down TR-101 front and back water sight glasses and manually dumped the back water.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter. Got approximatly 1/4 litre of oil, maybe less.</p>

<p>Home hardware delivered bottled water.</p>

<p>V-107 flow was swinging. Called Vermilion and they are out there with CCM adjusting valves and doing some programming ect...</p>

<p>Increased amine regen tops temp abit. Was at 95 degrees. Opened up valve from 41-43%.</p>

<p>Increased de bute fan speed.</p>

<p>Lowered the res gas cooler temp setpoint from 31 to 30 degrees to cool down the inlet temp to the amine contactor abit.</p>

<p>Took an amine concentration. It is at 37%. Coming down slowly. Left pump at 15%. Will take another titration tomorrow and adjust pump as needed.</p>

<p>Glycol level bouncing around. Lowered the glycol seperator slightly. Seemed to hang in there without having to add any glycol.</p>

<p>Blew down TR-101 front and back water sight glasses and manually dumped the back water.</p>

<p>Kevin Tonne replacing burnt out lights in the sales compressor building.</p>

<p>Devin and Kevin working on V-207 dump valve. Having issues getting it to open fully. Seems to barely crack open and not flow enough to register on the turbine meter.</p>

<p>Cleaned TR-101 exchanger screen.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers and tarps abit on the trim cooler, north side.</p>

<p>Production tank rang in hi level. Pembina kicked on a couple times but not for long. Called them and they kicked us on and said they will pump us down.</p>

<p>Vermilion washed out a valve on 16-04 well. They shut it in. Was down for about an hour. They kicked it back on. it hit us fairly hard and sent a hickup through the amine.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in two loads of Baccalieu oil.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the cyclone seperator and the inlet coalescer filter.</p>
