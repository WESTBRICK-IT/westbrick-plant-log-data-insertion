========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Lowered tarps on the trim cooler</p>

<p>Tightened packing on the glycol pump</p>

<p>Changed out the filters on the south glycol pot, and put the north pot in service. The filters we have are a little different, as they have no holders for springs on top, also installed a new gasket</p>

<p>Glycol level in the accumulator seems to be bouncing around now</p>

<p>HVO (Brett) hauled in a load of Baccalieu oil from 3-16</p>

<p>Had problems at the start of the shift at Braz North, the flare knockout rang in on high level and it did not want to pump down. Went back later and increased the flow rate on the pump and it started pumping down</p>

<p>V-200 pump trouble ringing in quite a bit, Grant can you check the nitrogen bottle</p>
