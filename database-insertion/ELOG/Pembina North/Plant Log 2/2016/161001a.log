========================================
<p>Lost K-206 on overspeed 01:50 . Tried to fire up however compressor still kept going down on overspeed. Had compressor idling fine when controlling the linkage manually but governor would not control properly. Staying open too far. Fired up K-203 to substitute for K-206. Dan K on his way out at 03:10am.</p>

<p>One pump in the production tank, the other in the truck offload line. Been recycling out of it all night.</p>

<p>Dealt with line pack issues due to compressor outage,. V-300 ESD on high header pressure, kept shutting esd on high pressure</p>

<p>Added glycol out of the reclimation tank after it dropped off due to drop in gas flow. Was not returniung. Started to freeze up, injected meth, &amp; added more gylcol from over head storage</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pumps.</p>

<p>TR-101 interface was steady all night and looked to be clear in sight glass. Never had chance to take a sample to see if it was worth batching SRW-6990.</p>
