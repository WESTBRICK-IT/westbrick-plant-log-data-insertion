<p>V-300 shut in at Braz today for some work. Splitter line was directed towards PN for most of the day. Adjusted V-3101 volumes as necessary to maintain noms.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 255)"><strong>Upon the V-300 shut down at Braz today, pressures rose at Mancal (their well being right close to 8-35). They have asked that we phone to notify them if pressures rise above 1500 kpa (at Braz) since their well loads up.</strong></span></span></p>
