========================================
<p>- Rob T and howard are doing acid gas packer test for the next for days. Will notice 0kPa</p>

<p>- Glycol had tons of hydrocarbon in the glycol sep, accumulator and flash tank. Skimmed them all and blew down flash tank and glycol sep float columns.</p>

<p>- Hooked a glycol baker pump up to the line from the flash tank level controller to the top of the stil column. Something let loose. Slowly have been closing the valve that goes to the reconcentrator instead of the top of the stil.</p>

<p>- Amine conc was below 40% and the reboiler level was 39%. Reclaimed as much as I could from underground and added from the over heads. Wanted to keep reboiler level around 50%. Will keep monitoring conc</p>

<p>- Swung V-101 to K-204 at 9:30 and out at 11:30</p>

<p>- Glycol conc Lean-77% Rich-71% Reclamation Tank-36%. Used the new digital reader. works slik</p>
