<p>Zee Medical out changing out medical supplies. (That green 15 min flush needs a hook and it can go up) FYI those saleen bags are $260.00 a piece and there are 2 of them.</p>

<p>Layed up the big pressure washer cart for the year</p>

<p>Found a small mess in Volcano building. Cleaned up and put soaker pads down. Leak is too small to tell if it is the pressure gauge or the pump. Will continue to monitor.</p>

<p>Made K-203 new LOTO to match</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">On cut backs. New NOM is 760e3m3</span></p>
