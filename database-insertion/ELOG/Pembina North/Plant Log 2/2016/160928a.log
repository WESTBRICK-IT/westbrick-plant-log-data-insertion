========================================
<p>Checked water plant and 9AM &amp; 3PM when it was running. All Good</p>

<p>Wednesday morning meeting</p>

<p>Measurement Inc out with Kristina working on flare meters and sales meters.<span style="color:#FF0000"> If a truck comes in tonight hauling oil can you please get a sample. as per Kristina</span></p>

<p>Cleaned up around the plant</p>

<p>Tightened 3 bull plugs on the high line to the hot oil heater</p>

<p>Had to clean garbage out of the metal bin. Please no garbage in the metal bin.</p>

<p>Rob T hauled in two loads of water. 6-6 and Braz water.</p>

<p>Worked on K-206 LOTO and matched it to the others. Any questions on these new LOTO&#39;s just ask.</p>

<p>Insulation list is on the white board. Guy is coming next week. If you see anythin, note it on the board.</p>

<p>Water well kinda acted up. If you look on trends you can see when the disposal pump was running, the tubing pressure flat lines a 3min but then the casing pressure raises pretty quick to 4500kPa.</p>
