========================================
<p>Around 20:00pm noticed K-206 recycle valve cycling due to high discharge pressure on Stg 2. After some trouble shooting noticed the stg 2 dish out of the cooler was ice cold to the touch, looked inside the cooler and seen that the louvers were open but calling to close. Used a pipe wrench and got them closed. Shortly after the disch pressure started to drop and the recycle valve closed off due to the pressure drop. Ambient temp isnt that cold so a possible pressure drop somewhere in the cooler bank causing freezing may be a possibility. Will continue to monitor but everything is looking good.</p>

<p>Went to braz and grabbed 4 barrels of oil from K-104 O/H tanks to use for the LPG pumps packing oil and H20 plant day tank due to it being much less expensive due to how much we go through for lubricating the packing. Oil is abit thinner so may lubricate the packing better.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps currently in the production tank.</p>

<p>Volcano heater leak seemed to stop around 22:00pm after it heated up for awhile.</p>

<p>Worked on safety strategies.</p>

<p>Lost volano approx 5 times during the night after kicking on to high fire. Started by itself each time.</p>
