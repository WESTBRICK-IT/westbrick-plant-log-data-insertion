========================================
<p>PNA, and 1-21 pigged today.&nbsp; Pulled PNA, it was dirty.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 1 load of Baccalieu emulsion.</p>

<p>One recycle in on the truck offload line, one is in production.</p>

<p>Glycol was jumping around so gave it a shot of methanol, lined out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowed the glycol pump down to 4.7 roots, to try and slow out glycol inj rate closer to what it should be.</p>

<p>Put the C3 condenser fan on to high speed.</p>

<p>Put the trim cooler temp up to 40 degrees to keep it close to the inlet temp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sped up debute cooler fans.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 due to Compressor high oil temp.</p>

<p>Ordered Lewcam for the water well clean up and possibly place down coconut mats.</p>

<p>Rob may bring some rig water tonight if Cynthia can&#39;t take it.</p>
