========================================
<p>-Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>-Glycol flow dropped off around 09:00am to approx 2.5 roots and the accumulator level seemed to follow, got as low as 20%, level wouldnt come back, increased pump rate to approx 4 roots (7m3), glycol sep and flash tank were both almost empty. Added abit from overheads, level dropped down again.</p>

<p>bypassed filters and level came back abit, changed filters. After about 4 hours accumulator level shot back up to 105%. Raised level in glycol sep after to get an interface. Level dropped again at shift change...</p>

<p>-HVO hauled in a load of 4-28 water and a load of oil is to come from 4-28 around 18:00 pm.</p>

<p>-Bached in 15L of SCW-6990 chemical due to black, dirty front water.</p>

<p>-Recycled off the truck offload line until HVO came in. One pump is now in the overflow and the other is in the production tankl.</p>
