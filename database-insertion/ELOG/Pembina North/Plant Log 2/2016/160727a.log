<p>Skimmed Amine Charcoal filters, skim of oil on top.</p>

<p>Pumped out of Glycol reclamation tank.</p>

<p>Treater main burner didnt kick on, found the main burner control valve closed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Found the valve that allows the controller to open was colsed.&nbsp; Opened up a crack and seems fine.</p>

<p>Grant fixed up the gravel by the new transformer, still soft in spots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sped up K-206 and K-201.</p>

<p>Raised glycol sep level so its about 1/3 in the sight glass.</p>
