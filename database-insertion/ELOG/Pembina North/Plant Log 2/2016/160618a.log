<p>Inlet 415.15&nbsp; <!--StartFragment-->Sales 372.89<!--EndFragment--></p>

<p>LPG 83.72&nbsp; <!--StartFragment-->Oil 73.58<!--EndFragment--></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Weekend Checks / PMs</p>

<p>Picked up used soaker pads at Sales / Gathering Compressors today. Rag / Filter bin at the compressors is full, so is the one at Process. Battery bin is half full. Will call Tervita for new ones on Monday.</p>

<p>Differential on the chiller was climbing all morning, Methanol did not help. Glycol level was dropping at the accumulator. Did not want to add from the reclamation tank due to the chiller freezing off. Added Glycol from the overheads. (10% in the accumulator, not enough to change the SG on the overhead storage tank) Shut down the C3 and the Glycol temporarily for 2 hrs to warm up. Restarted C3 and Glycol Pumps.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller De-oiler during warm up</p>

<p>Added C3 to the surge tank (up to 8 bolts)</p>

<p>C3 cooler fan on high</p>

<p>HVO brought one load of oil from 2-10 Baccalieu</p>

<p>North Slope out to finish spraying for weeds at the Acid Gas well today</p>
