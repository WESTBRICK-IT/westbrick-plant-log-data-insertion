========================================
<p>Front water on TR-101 was dirty, but was reading 3 bolts, just hard to see.</p>

<p>Went to braz due to VHP cold sep high level ringing in, opened up bypass around dump valve and level dropped. Stroked valve, and turned on methanol to VHP for awhile. seems to be holding level abit better but still controlling.</p>

<p>reclimation tank rang in high level. Pumped down and raised level in glycol sep.</p>

<p>Turned off glycol makeup pump.</p>
