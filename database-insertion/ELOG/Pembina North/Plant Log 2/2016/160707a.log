<p>Put both recycle pumps back on the production tank. Level in the water tank rose continuously until we switched the pumps. We switched them when the water tank hit 14 feet to give the booster pumps some time to catch up. Checked treater throughout the night to ensure we&#39;re not dumping oil.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter, no oil</p>

<p>1 LPG truck</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#000080">Daily production numbers for Oil / Water will likely be out today due to recycling off the truck offload line.</span></strong></p>
