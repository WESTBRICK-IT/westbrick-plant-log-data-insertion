========================================
<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Clean.</p>

<p>Drained lube oils off bottom of the chiller.</p>

<p>Glycol foaming up.&nbsp; Opened bypass on glycol sep for 10 mins till level back in sight glass.&nbsp; Closed bypass.</p>

<p>Level in production tank up over 5 meters.&nbsp; Called Pembina Pipe.&nbsp; Kicked on pumps.&nbsp; BS&amp;W down to 0.8.</p>

<p>Opened up V-200 inlets all the way.&nbsp; Flowing approx. 18 e3m3, WPNA probably loaded up.&nbsp; Got pressure down to 200 kpa.&nbsp; 1-21 pipeline down to 250kpa.</p>

<p>Opened up inlet on V-104 all the way.&nbsp; Pressure down to 200 KPA.&nbsp; Will have to block in and pressure up to dump when level gets high enough.</p>

<p>Closed all doors in process to warm up process to help oil flow to Kenco on C3B.&nbsp; Also added oil to lubricators.&nbsp; Dayshift please keep eye on level.</p>

<p>Recieved load of Baccaleiu oil from 2-17 from HVO.</p>

<p>Unplugged drain line for amine charge pump.</p>

<p>Raised levels on V-200 and V-101.</p>

<p>Shut off booster pumps at the water plant.</p>

<p>Added glycol to K-204.</p>

<p>Picked cottom from compressor screens.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps out of the production tank.</p>

<p>Lowered De-eth temp to 83 from 85 due to decreased pressure on De-eth.</p>

<p>Increased acid gas discharge relief to flare to 8500 KPA from 8200 KPA.&nbsp; Well pressuring up.</p>

========================================
<p>Glycol is hanging up in separator boot leg, added glycol from reclamation tank</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter, pumped out amine drip tank</p>

<p>Worked on acid gas 1st stage scrubber, frosting up, added 200L methanol to scrubber and let sit for afternoon, KPA pumped 3 m3 of methanol down acid gas well to try and fix discharge pressure</p>

<p>worked on C3B kenco and Dan pulled a vacuum on oil line from overhead 260 tank, it was air locked and is back to normal operation&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hot oil heater had both pumps running,&nbsp;shut down pump B</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 4 loads of Baccalieu oil</p>

<p>North Slope had two trucks&nbsp;out spraying weeds around plant,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cleaned up soaker pads around K-202, glycol level is low in expansion tank need to filled on night shift, also can night shift suck out trenches around K-202 and replace soaker pads, talked to Dan about replacing water pump for next Thursday June.16</p>

<p>TR-101 had no interface in both sight glasses and dumped 40 m3 since yesterday, noticed equalizing valves were open so I closed them and monitored through out day</p>
