========================================
<p>-Level was hanging up in glycol sep. Back flowed with methanol through control valve. All good.</p>

<p>-Rob hauled in Braz h20 and sucked out floor drain and instrument air drum.</p>

<p>-Marty hauled in Bigoray oil.</p>

<p>-Dalmac hauled in a load of Insch oil.</p>

<p>-Opened up methanol valve on de-eth reflux pump disch and other above LP cold sep due to level hanging up in accumulator. Methanol didnt seem to help. Cooled off bottoms temp from 83 to 80 to try and warm up the tops temp to see if it would help the pumps to catch up. Didnt seem to help.</p>

<p>-Dumped berms.</p>

<p>-Cleaned up containments from acid gas valve swap.</p>

<p>-Pumped up acid gas well ESD.</p>
