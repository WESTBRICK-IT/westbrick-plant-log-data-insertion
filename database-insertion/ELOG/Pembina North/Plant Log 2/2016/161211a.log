<p>Glycol levels really bouncing around last night. Accumulator level dropped to 0%. Pressure was down on the flash tank, brought it back up to 150 Kpa. Pumped from glycol reclaimation tank to regain level.</p>

<p>Rest of the plant ran steady.</p>

<p>Swung into the truck offload line this am due to a wet load from Baccalieu. Currently still in there.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Pumped methanol into V-3101 inlet exchanger. Gas flow jumped up approx 50m3.</p>

<p>Shut in Braz V-102 after bringing it on due to it holding out rat creek (V-103/107). LP ppms climbed up abit also. Nightshift can you please slowly bring V-102 on and try to keep rat creek pressures low.</p>

<p>Cleaned up glycol and sucked out gutter around K-204.</p>

<p>Pumped down the reclimation tank.</p>

<p>Res gas cooler louvers were saying 0% open but were still actually open about 30% Manually adjusted the louvers so at 0% on the computer the louvers are closed.</p>

<p>Opened up K-202 louvers 1 notch.</p>
