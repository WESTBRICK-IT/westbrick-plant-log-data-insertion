========================================
<p>Sped up k-201 and K-206</p>

<p>Got a load of Baccalieu oil from HVO (4-28)</p>

<p>Washed gator, had a service light and oil pressure light that pops up the odd time now, most likely due to washing the engine, still runs normal and checked all fluid levels (all good).</p>

<p>Drug the front yard, ground was very hard and wasnt doing much so didnt do the rest of the plant.</p>

<p>Closed off the valve from the glycol flash tank to the reclimation tank, held 2 bolts all night. Hopefully it hang in there.</p>

<p>Pumped down the reclimation tank slowly to the accumulator.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filters, slight skim of oil.</p>

========================================
<p>K-206 dow at 5:48 am this morning. It didnt ring in. rebooted panel as the unit would not start (it was still showing runing on the DCS). Mech Nagy and Brandon eventually had to replace the governor on the unit.</p>

<p>Started K-203 and ran in K-206 mode.</p>

<p>Mech Brandon fixed glycol leak on K-205 JW pump this morning, started K-204 in K-205 mode meanwhile.</p>

<p>Once K-205 was back up and running swapped K-204 back to normal and ran K-203 &amp; K-204 in lieu of K-206.</p>

<p>Lost C3 compressor multiple times due to the process upsets. glycol level dropped out multiple times, it was hanging up in the Glycol sep. drained it via bypass to stoke the glycol boot dump valve a few times. levels returned to normal after that.</p>

<p>added glycol form the reclamation tank</p>

<p>shut down glycol pumps during process upsets temporarily</p>

<p>changed amine bag filter</p>

<p>bypassed fire eye for Alan to cut some grating this morning. They&#39;re back in service now.</p>

<p>Shannon says we might get our water well back on thursday afternoon, friday morning at latest. will have to play by year our water levels until then.</p>
