========================================
<p>Noms down to 784.6e3m3, monitored inlets.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-201 to 800 RPM due to recycle 65% open.</p>

<p>At 02:30 this morning the 6-19 ESD alarmed in, monitored pressures seems normal.&nbsp; Should get a field rep. to check it out.</p>

<p>Closed south side louvers on Amine trim cooler, to keep the temps.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps are in the Production tank, low level in Overflow.</p>

<p>Snugged up packing on glycol pump (north).</p>

<p>Braz slowed down K103 due to loosing 100e3m3 on the Rat Creek line.</p>

<p>Turned off the monitor with the camera on it due to the flickering bugging me.&nbsp; Turned monitor back on and all the cameras are gone.&nbsp; So yeah, sorry!</p>
