========================================
<p>De-Eth reflux level bouncing around, increased bottom temps to 89 from 85 degrees c.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finished off weekend checks.</p>

<p>HVO dropped off 1 load of Baccalieu emulsion, and 1 load of water. Both from 4-28.</p>

<p>One pump in overflow and the other in the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Cleaned up abit around the plant.</p>

<p>Sped up K-201 abit due to incresed gas flow.</p>

<p>De-eth reflux level swinging, tried to increse bottmoms temp, swinging got worse. May have to run reboiler temp in manual for awhile to level everything out.</p>

<p>Flared off de-eth reflux pump discharge due to vapour locking.</p>
