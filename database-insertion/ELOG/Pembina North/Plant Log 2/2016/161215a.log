========================================
<p>Glycol level was swinging quite rapidly, got mike to look at the transmiter, pump up the glycol leg and expand the range, still swinging abit but seems to be trending alot better than before.</p>

<p>Currently recycling out of the truck offload line.</p>

<p>Baker Hughes delivered 800L of PAO 1001U</p>

<p>GGT offloaded Bigoray 15-07 oil.</p>

<p>Dank K serviced the amine water makeup pump.</p>

<p>Mike M did lean oil pump PM&#39;s.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, just a very light skim of oil.</p>

<p>Slightly raised the level in the glycol flash tank a little due to it staying right in the bottom of the site glass.</p>
