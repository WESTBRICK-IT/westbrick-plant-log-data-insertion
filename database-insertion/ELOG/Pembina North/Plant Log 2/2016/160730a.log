========================================
<p>Glycol level hung aroung the 50% level all day. Glycol sep and flash tank levels were controlling so didnt bother adding to the accumulator as we were getting good returns.</p>

<p>Blaine pigged the splitter and 5-21 line.</p>

<p>Marty with GGT hauled in 15-07 Bigoray split load.</p>

<p>Got the water well pumping after lunch, casing pressure is staying around 50 KPA but the tubing pressure is over 11,000 KPA. Probably will have to do an acid squeeze next week.</p>

<p>Swung one pump into the overflow tank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>
