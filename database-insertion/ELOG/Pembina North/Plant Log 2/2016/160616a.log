<p>Started K-206 and had some issues with the JW switch on the overhead glycol surge tank. &nbsp;Kevin T fixed. &nbsp;Dan also had to change out two leads for 3L and 4L heads. &nbsp;Running good now.</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 and K-204 and swung V-103 gas back to the MP header.</p>

<p>Glycol reboiler leaking badly on the north end on the seal betweent the hot oil bundle and the vessel. &nbsp;Tightened up bolts, some where pretty loose. &nbsp;Now only dripping once every couple minutes.</p>

<p>Glycol level bouncing around due to foaming issues in the glycol seperator. &nbsp;Opened up by-pass and got level back in sight glass and put back to normal operations. &nbsp;Seems to have leveled out.</p>

<p>V-101 slugged in for about an hour and high leveled a couple times. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Recycling out of the overflow tank. &nbsp;BS&amp;W at 0%.</p>

<p>Terra Pure out to load used lube oil.</p>
