<p>Recycled off truck off load, one pump in each tank now</p>

<p>GGT-Rob hauled in one load of Braz water</p>

<p>Glycol-adjusted flash tank level to get a level, later lost glycol flow &amp; level, flow boucing around, put on manul for awhile, level in the glycol sep was high adjusted level control on it, added a little from reclaim tank. Level swung for abit but eventually leveled out.</p>

<p>skimmed amine charcoal filter/clean, blew down chiller deoiler</p>

<p>Dan dropped off k202 heads, tye assisted to unload</p>

<p>Dan called they where all finished &amp; locking up at braz at 21:00 hrs</p>

<p>Chiller temp warmed up and differential climbed when glycol flow and level was bouncing around. Gave it one shot of methanol and everything seemed to line out.</p>
