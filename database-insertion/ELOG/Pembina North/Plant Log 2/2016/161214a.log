========================================
<p>-Hvo delivered 2 loads of Bacalu oil</p>

<p>-The lean oil accumulator ringing in on high level, looked around the skid and could see no where there would be liquid getting in. Left as is for the pump is torn apart.</p>

<p>Had a look at the lean oil skid to figure out where the level in the accumulator was coming from. The valve off the bottom of the accumulator inside the building is tied into the bottom of the sight glass/level indicator, so the liquid in the sight glass<br />
warmed up due to building heat and a lower pressure due to the blocked in fuel gas causing the level in the glass to rise and giving the indicator a higher level. Cracked open the bottom valve for a second and the level dropped and the alarm cleared.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros hauled in 5m3 of process water.</p>

<p>The pressure transmiter on the c3 surge tank was gummed up causing it to give a lower reading, which closed the louvers on the cooler bank and pressured up the surge tank causing it to start flaring, with no indication why. Mike cleaned out the<br />
transmitter and it started reading again. All good.</p>

<p>Dan K worked on the lean oil pump some more.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, very light skim of oil.</p>

<p>Recycling off of the truck offload line currently. Will have to swing out of it tonight.</p>

<p>Darren working on cameras.</p>

<p>Added c3 to the surge tank after we flared it off.</p>

<p>Highmark was out taking water samples for bacteria analysis for Ken L.</p>

<p>Worked on the master action item list abit.</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol flash tank slightly because the level dropped this am to the very bottom of the glass and the level in the glycol accumulator was running full at the time.</p>

<p>Glycol is jumping around abit but is staying above 75% most of the time.</p>
