========================================
<p>IEC (Mike) Testing louvers on compressors, check K-203 kenco oil level, K-201, K-203 PM&#39;s</p>

<p>Tarpon (Jeremy) changing out lights in process, UPS and MCC&#39;s inspections</p>

<p>Core Labs (Alex) out getting sour samples</p>

<p>Kel Tech (Warren) out trouble shooting radio issues</p>

<p>GGT (Marty) brought in a load of Bigoray oil from 15-7</p>

<p>Dan K loaded engine heads on a trailer</p>

<p>Relaced windsock at the acid gas compressor</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 and started up K-201 to replace the grease nipple for K-203 suction scrubber. The valve still leaks around the grease nipple. Sent a couple of valves in for service to hopefully replace the one on K-203. If you have to start up K-203 please monitor closely the grease nipple on the inlet valve to the suction scrubber</p>
