========================================
<p>Lost C3-B x2 last night. Once at midnight and once at 5:00 am. Trends showing it&#39;s going down on Hi suc scrubber level (propane). closed manual valve last night on C3 hot gas make up valve line to see if it was causing the issue. Didn&#39;t seem like it was the problem.</p>

<p>Sped up K-202, and closed louvers a little due to low ambient temp</p>

<p>HVO delivered one load of water last night</p>

<p>One recycle pump in the production tank and one on the overflow tank</p>
