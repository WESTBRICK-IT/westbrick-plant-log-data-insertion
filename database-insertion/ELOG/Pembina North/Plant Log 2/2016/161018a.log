========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter (very little oil)</p>

<p>Tried to blow down the chiller de-oiler, no luck</p>

<p>The flare knock-out bypass valve to the solenoid was open (closed)</p>

<p>The acid gas flare knock-out high levelled and would not pump down, all good now</p>

<p>Switched pumps on the de-ethanizer reflux, did not seem to help any</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps on the Production Tank</p>

<p>Blew down FI-3007, was reading flow when the valve was shut</p>

<p>Blew down LIC-3111, re-filled glycol leg</p>
