========================================
<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter (clean)</p>

<p>Pumped out the amine drip tank</p>

<p>Changed out the process H2s analyzer tape</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Work ordered H2s analyzer head 5000A ringing in on negative value, W.O. # 23783</p>

<p>Work ordered K-202 cylinder # 2 outboard discharge temp, W.O. # 23784</p>

<p>Jeff B from Zeta came down to get some methanol and swagelock fittings</p>

<p>Glycol level giving us some grief, flash tank level not dumping properly. Raised the pressure and adjusted controller, now around 2.5 bolts. Lowered the glycol level in the boot leg of the glycol separator, and added a little glycol from the overheads</p>

<p>Both re-cycle pumps are in the production tank</p>
