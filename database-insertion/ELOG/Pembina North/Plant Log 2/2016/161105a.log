========================================
<p>-Drove to Braz at the start of the shift to fix V-103 high level.</p>

<p>-We tried the radion communication between Zeta and Pemb Norht and it would not work.</p>

<p>-No audable alarms would ring in on the Zeta computor and we could not adjust any set points. Jeff spent most of the night at Zeta.</p>

<p>-Had a couple of calls come in on the cell phone that were dropped calls.</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter.</p>
