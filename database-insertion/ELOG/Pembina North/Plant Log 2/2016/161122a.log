========================================
<p>Amine Concentration at 43.1% left make up pump as is</p>

<p>Orientated Techmation Operator for Pennwest, He was out to test 11-22 well ESD today</p>

<p>Dan Replaced impeller on Volcano Heater Pump (East). De-LOTO&#39;d and switched to East pump. Shut down West Pump and blocked in for work tomorrow</p>

<p>Jeremy finished tieing in WiFi at the battery, and ran LEL calibrations</p>

<p>Braz shutdown Key Meeting this afternoon</p>

<p>Grant plowed snow around the plant this afternoon</p>

<p>Finished up ERP Action Items today</p>

<p>Pembina out to look at their analyzer today (BS&amp;W)</p>

<p>Braz LP header H2S rang in at 4:30 pm. Trends on V-108 showed it was started 1 hour before the spike in H2S. Shut it in and H2S started dropping immediately. Called Kim with Pennwest and notified. He said his scavenger was pumping while he was there, but he just got to town so he wasn&#39;t going back tonight. If nightshift wants they can try to bring it on slow, if not we will get it tomorrow.</p>
