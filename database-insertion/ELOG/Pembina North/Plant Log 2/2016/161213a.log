========================================
<p>Checked on the Volcano check valves tonight. No leaks.</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000CD"><strong>V-100 up at Braz seems to have broken it&#39;s ice block a little over night. Level controller was not calling for dump but when Dallas tripped it the vessel dumped. He dumped it from 68% to approx 56% without issue.</strong></span></p>

<p>Acid Gas Flare Knockout would not dump last night, lowered the pressure on the Water Flash Tank to allow pump to clear the level in the A/G Kockout. Raised pressure back up afterwards.</p>

<p>Raised level in the Glycol Seperator a bit due to lots of glycol returns at the glycol regen.</p>

<p>Switched both recycle pumps to the Production Tank due to low level at the Overflow Tank</p>

<p>Cleaned up a few soaker pads and rags last night</p>

<p>Mancal lost their field compressor last night (V-103) Trevor called to see if we had problems before heading out to start it back up.</p>

========================================
<p>LOTO on lean oil pump to replace packing and for oil change. Plungers need to be sent away for repair, pump will be locked out for a few days.</p>

<p>Ordered process water, Nelson bros will call back this evening, they are trying to line up a clean truck for us.</p>

<p>Taggart delivered Scale inhibitor.</p>

<p>Lowered the water flash tank pressure to 300 KPA from 340 KPA due to the acid gas flare K/O not being able to dump. At 300 KPA both the acid gas and the water flash tank seem to be dumping fine. (Dropped pressure by closing the fuel gas regulator 1/2 turn otherwise it would flare)</p>

<p>HVO delivered 4-28 Baccalieu oil/water, (split load)</p>
