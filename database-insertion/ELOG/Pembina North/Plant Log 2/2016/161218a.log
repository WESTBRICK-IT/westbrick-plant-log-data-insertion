========================================
<p>Tightened packing on middle plunger of amine charge pump</p>

<p>Turned on de-but OH fan, Turn C3 condenser fans on to fast, Opened tarps on amine trim cooler</p>

<p>Blew down the glycol float column on the flash tank. It was staying open and dumping all the glycol in the flash tank. Maintaining at 3.5 bolts</p>

<p>Grant batched the treater with SRW-6990 because of incompadabilities</p>

<p>Water flash tank would not pump. Cleaned y screen and pulled meter there was nothing. Also fought with the acid gas flare knock out pump. Played with pressures to get it to pump.</p>

<p>Had to do a warm up today. The pressure transmitter on the inlet of the gas to gas had frozen up along with the needle valve to block it in. Unload C3, warmed up, made sure the transmitter and needle valve were thawed. Blew out the ice, started C3 back up. All good.</p>

<p>Hvo hauled in a load of 4-28 Baccaleui water and one load of oil.</p>
