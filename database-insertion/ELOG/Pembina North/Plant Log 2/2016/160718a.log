========================================
<p>HVO hauled in a load of Baccalieu&nbsp;oil from 4-28</p>

<p>Nigel drained the glycol out of K-203</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Added glycol from the reclamation tank</p>

<p>Slowed down K-103 at Braz, ringing in on high engine oil temp, left K-103 slowed down to help with our NOM&#39;s</p>

<p>Work ordered the level controller for the glycol flash tank, not holding a proper level (W.O. # 23789)</p>
