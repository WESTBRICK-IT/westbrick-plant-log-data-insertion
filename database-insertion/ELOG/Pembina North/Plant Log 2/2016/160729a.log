<p>monitored K-205 glycol level from Day shift who filled it, no change from 90%</p>

<p>Glycol in process was steady all night</p>

<p>inlet to water tank in water plant ESD closed on high level, treater water levels front and back is 3 bolts (day shift please monitor through out day)</p>

<p>skimmed amine charcoal filters</p>

========================================
<p>-Glycol was steady all night, then at about 06:00am the accumulator level dropped off. Glycol sep was full and flash tank was slowly filling up. Manually dumped out the glycol sep and cracked open the valve from the flash tank to the reconcentrator</p>

<p>to maintain flash tank level. Glycol sep still not controlling. Pumped methanol back through the control valve and level seemed to line out on the system. continued to monitor during shift, all good. May need to close valve to reconcentrator during nightshift.</p>

<p>-Mike raised the high level shutdown on the h20 plant until the h20 well is able to take h20 as the ESD inlet to water plant was ESD&#39;d. Level shutdown raised to approx 19ft before it ESD&#39;s again. Shannon will probably swing by control room to let us know the progress.</p>

<p>-Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>-Slowed down K-206 and K-201.</p>

<p>-Amine concentration is at 43.1%. Left H20 makeup pump at 8. Will monitor throughout weekend.</p>

<p>-May need to raise level in glycol sep as the accumulator level is slowly creeping up. Was just waiting to see where it lines out at.</p>
