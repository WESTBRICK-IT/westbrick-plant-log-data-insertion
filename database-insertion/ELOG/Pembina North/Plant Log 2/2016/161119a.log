<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter.&nbsp; Some oil.</p>

<p>Found valve to amine drain header off amine reboiler open half way.&nbsp; Closed and inserted a peice of bent tubing to make sure it doesn&#39;t accidentally get bumped open again.</p>

<p>Glycol bouncing around.&nbsp; Lowered level in glycol seperator a little, blew down float column and sight glass on flash tank.&nbsp; Added a shot of methanol to E-3101 to help with returns.</p>

<p>Glycol flow indicator not reading correctly.&nbsp; While adjusting flows, froze off front end of the plant, while the whole time flowing more glycol than usual according to the trends.&nbsp; Started methanol right away.&nbsp; Added glycol from overhead tank.</p>

<p>Lost C3 compressor on high Res gas discharge pressure.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of oil.</p>

<p>Went through process and amine with Ryan Blair.</p>
