========================================
<p>Recycling out of both tanks</p>

<p>Shut off water inj. pumps, at 6.1 foot level</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS and reviewed SOP&#39;s</p>

<p>Knocked down K-103 to see if Tye could start it.&nbsp; Probably will verify his competency again later down the line. &nbsp; OK I knocked it down by setting the suction controller to 65 kpa instead of 650 kpa.</p>
