========================================
<p>Pollard out to finish insulation installs.</p>

<p>Core Labs out for weekly and monthly samples.</p>

<p>K-201 service.</p>

<p>K-206 went down due to speed governor issues. Down for the night should be back up tomorrow. Lost C3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39; after K-206 went down. Fired up K-203 to take on K-206 roll.</p>

<p>Inlet froze off during all the compressor outages. Added methanol to front end. Pressure dropped. Fired back up at shift change.</p>

<p>One pump in overflow one pump in production tank.</p>

========================================
<p>-Plant inlet froze off again, Added methanol, Fired up c3 &#39;&#39;B&#39;&#39;. Glycol Pumps running but not flowing anything causing E-3101 gas to gas exchanger to slowly freeze off. Increased the VFD speed from 0% output to 20% output, and changed glycol flow control overide setpoint from 5 roots to 6 roots. Pump pressure and flow climed up abit but was bouncing around. Blew down nozzles to E-3101 exchanger to flare and the pressure and flow lined out.</p>

<p>-Shut down the c3 2 speed fan.</p>

<p>-Equalized the glycol reclimation tank.</p>

<p>-HVO delivered a load of oil.</p>

<p>-Went to braz deal with K-104 issues.</p>

<p>-Swung both pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>-Added a little bit of glycol from the overhead tank. After the pumps started flowing we couldnt get returns for awhile.</p>

<p>-Submitted work order for battery truck offload meter. Read 18m3 high on HVO ticket#93318.</p>

<p>-Lowered level in glycol sep slightly. Level getting quite high in sight glass and glycol accumulator level running fairly low.</p>
