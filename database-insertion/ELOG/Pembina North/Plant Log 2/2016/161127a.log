========================================
<p>Finished weekend checks</p>

<p>Changed amine bag filter due to long period of time between changes. DP flatlined for a long time.</p>

<p>Drained amine skim tank to underground</p>

<p>Tightened packing on glycol pump today</p>

<p>Received slug of fluids on V-3101 today. Pincehed 14-03 and 05-21 lines until it drained. Could not figure out where it came from. Didn&#39;t seem like it was any un-notified pigging.</p>

<p>Both pumps are in the Production Tank</p>
