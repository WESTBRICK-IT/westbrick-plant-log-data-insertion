========================================
<p>- Sales analyzer rang in high H2S. Just a reminder when you change tape, that you make the tape go around all the pins. If you miss the counter pin the tape will sit there and spin and not ring in on low tape. Put new tape on, all good.</p>

<p>- Water plant inlet was ESD. Had to clear to get treater to dump water.</p>

<p>- Water flash tank meter not accumulating.&nbsp; Closed and opened suction a few times.&nbsp; Got lucky and blew through what ever was plugging it.</p>

<p>- Both pumps out of the production tank.</p>
