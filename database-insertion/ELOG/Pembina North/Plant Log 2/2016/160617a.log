<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>Blew down the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Had to slow down K-201 for high compressor temp, sped up after temps cooled down</p>

<p>Glycol seemed to be hanging up in the glycol separator boot leg</p>

<p>Front end looked like it was starting to freeze off, so hit the front end with some methanol</p>

<p>Changed out the process H2s analyzer tape</p>

<p>Currently adding glycol from the reclamation tank</p>

<p>We do not have any more drinking water, may have to call for some</p>
