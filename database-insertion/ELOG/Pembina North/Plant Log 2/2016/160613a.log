<p>Cleaned up at K-202</p>

<p>Still no interface built up on the Treater sightglasses, ensured neither the front or back water was dumping</p>

<p>Lowered level in K-201 scrubber form 50% down to 10%</p>

<p>Lost level slowly overnight in Glycol accumulator, Added glycol from reclamation tank</p>

<p>Blew down the glycol filter pots</p>

========================================
<p>Acid gas well pressure is slowly coming down, Work ordered the acid gas compressor re-cycle valve, as it looks like it is not closing and probably needs the trim adjusted. W.O. # 23433</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, and blew down the chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>The Amine concentration is at 41.9 %, left the make-up water set at 3.</p>

<p>Tarpon (Kevin) working on calibrating LEL heads, and communications in process for the GC. K-206 jacket water temp</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">Sales H2s tape rang in on low tape, now on by-pass</span></p>

<p>Added glycol from the reclamation tank and a little bit from the overheads as our concentrations are a little low.</p>

<p>Dan working on the water pump for K-202, Locked out K-202 and started up K-208. K-202 is now back on-line</p>
