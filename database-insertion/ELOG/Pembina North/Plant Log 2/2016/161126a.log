<p>Weekend Checks</p>

<p>Amine titration at 42.5 %</p>

<p>V-101 Hi levelled. Drained and restarted.</p>

<p>Controlled V-3101 and V-103 to hold noms today</p>

<p>One recycle pump on the Production tank and one on the Overflow tank</p>

<p>pumped down the the glycol reclamaition tank.</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol sep</p>

<p>Raised the output on the amine reboiler temp control valve from 37% to 38%, Reboiler temp came up and held steady.</p>
