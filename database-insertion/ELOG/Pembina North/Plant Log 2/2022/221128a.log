========================================
<p>Weather cloudy windy -13</p>

<p>Called Pembina control to try starting the pumps, Pumped 45m3 and the pumps shut off on low tank level. Will wait for the shipping tank level to be high enough to start again but I do believe the density was within the limits now.</p>

<p>Production tank level at 19:00 was 3.25 meters. Confirmed with the temp gun.</p>

<p>Closed the louvers a little on K-202 compressor</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on the acid gas compressor</p>

<p>Pinched in louvers on the amine trim cooler.</p>

<p>Added glycol from the overhead tank</p>
