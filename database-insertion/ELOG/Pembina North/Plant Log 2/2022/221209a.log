========================================
<p>Weather sunny -3 little hazzy from nearby burning brush piles.</p>

<p>Mark pigged 14-3 line, pig came in and is pulled clean.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on low suction when 14-3 pig arrived. Restarted and it ran good</p>

<p>Had Clayton look at the amine water makeup pump and he found that the discharge was bypassing through the psv. Changed out the psv and it was still bypassing. With further looking Nathan found the heatrace on the amine add line breaker tripped. Now we figure the line was froze off and we are waiting for it to thaw.</p>

<p>Added a little amine from the overhead tank, seems to be pumping fine.</p>

<p>Added oil to amine charge pump (P-4700) crank case.</p>

<p>Amine concentration 40%</p>

<p>Nathan and Devin finished up the lel detection checks and calibrations.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk hauled in several loads of Zeta Creek water.</p>

<p>Had to reset the water plant 1 time on high discharge pressure.</p>
