========================================
<p><strong>Weather -33&deg;C; clear. Stayed cold at around -32&deg;C</strong>.</p>

<p>14-3 went down around 6:17PM. Operator got it going around 8:30 PM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vermilion gas flow was bouncing around. Talked to the operator and he mentioned that one of their flowing well is down with a swab rig. Most of the ones that&#39;s running right now are plunger lifts.</p>

<p>K201 glycol leaked. Snugged the union and put some soaker pads around to absorb the glycol on the floor.&nbsp;Sent service request for the mechanic to check before we top it up. SR#6064779. Submitted MITS# 29873.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de-eth compressor suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K204 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Checked production tank level with a temp gun at 3.75 M around 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Lowered glycol level a little bit on glycol separator.</p>

<p>11-11 spiked up H2S PPM to 9 PPM. Texted operator.</p>

<p>Called Pembina around 12;30AM. Went down on density. Slowed down recycle pump from 150 to 75 M3/day. Please try it again later.</p>

<p>No security issues at Braz north.</p>

========================================
<p>weather was cold lows close to -40</p>

<p>Tank level was 3.80 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Called pembina pipeline to see if we meet spec ,they pumped 6.4 and went down on density @770</p>

<p>The domestic water line has a leak ,we shut down the well and closed the valve on it,</p>

<p>We called a plumper out to have a look at it, not much they can do until its dug up .</p>

<p>We ordered a washroom trailer , Nathan has it wired it in.We couldn&#39;t get one with a shower in it.</p>

<p>Called Ken Leask and he has got the ground distrubance started</p>

<p>RPM out to fill our overhead glycol tank</p>

<p>V-101 esd closed and wouldn&#39;t open. we took hot water down to it and got it back open .</p>

<p>Safety meeting today</p>

<p>plowed snow around the domestic water well in prep for line locators tomorrow.</p>

<p>Acid gas well will be ready to go tomorrow</p>

========================================
<p>Weather cold -31 dropping to -36</p>

<p>Closed the equalizing valve for the production and overflow tanks.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, very little oil.</p>

<p>Westbrick 14-3 esd shut around 12:30 am, plant lost 90% of the flow.</p>

<p>Lost K-206 on low suction, restarted and opened up the manual bypass valve to help out with the suction pressure until 14-3 was back flowing.</p>

<p>Lost the c3 compressor on lubricator flow. Started back up</p>

<p>Had to add glycol a couple of times because of no returns.</p>

<p>14-3 back flowing at 2:00 am</p>

<p>V-104 shut in on high level, tried pumping methanol down the bump line but had no luck.</p>
