========================================
<p><u><strong>Weather: 20&deg;C start of shift, 9&deg;C this morning.</strong></u></p>

<p>- Mechanics working on K-5000 overhaul at the start of shift, extended the work permit.</p>

<p>- Process analyzer around 4 PPM at the start of shift and 2PPM on sales, started climbing early in the shift to around 6 PPM on process and 3 PPM on sales.</p>

<p>- Opened up the amine reboiler heat medium to 32% to maintain regen tops temp around 97&deg;C.</p>

<p>- Tested inlets, WPNE was 50PPM, shut in WPNE, called Dalton with Vermillion and notified him, he will do some looking into it.</p>

<p>- Turned on the amine water make-up pump.</p>

<p>- Opened up the 50/50 blend gas to 30%.</p>

<p>- Opened up 1-21 pipeline.</p>

<p>- Bypassed the acid gas well pressure shutdown due to K-5000 being down for the overhaul.</p>

<p>- Started up amine reflux pump P-4510 once we started building a level in the reflux accumulator.</p>

<p>- De-eth O/H methanol pump was vapor locked, bled the gas out of it and it is pumping now.</p>

<p>- Amine booster pump was surging so I switched pumps but it still continued to surge, sped up the amine charge pump to 37% from 20%, 180L/min to 226L/min, all good now.</p>

<p>- Drained the chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>- Manually dumped K-203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>- K-201 compressor oil was overfull, drained some oil out of it, down to 85% in the sightglass, submitted a workorder to have the compressor oil kenco repaired. W.O# 4877168.</p>

<p>- K-204 engine oil kenco isn&#39;t adding oil. W.O# 4877168.</p>

<p>- Some lights are burnt out in the inlet header building, workordered for Nathan to replace them. W.O# 4877170.</p>

<p>- Switched the 2-speed C3 condenser fan from &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;slow&quot;.</p>

<p>- Blew down the inlet and horizontal coalescers, lowered the level in the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>- LPG pump packing lubricators weren&#39;t dripping, took apart the tubing and cleaned it, all good..</p>
