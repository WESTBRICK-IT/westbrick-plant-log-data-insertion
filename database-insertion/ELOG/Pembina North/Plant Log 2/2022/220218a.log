========================================
<p>Weather: -3 snow in the morning</p>

<p>-Morning meeting</p>

<p>-V-200 high levelled multiple times in the morning.&nbsp; Kim lost 1-21 last night and fired up this morning causing fluid to come it.&nbsp; Called and let me know before starting back up</p>

<p>-KPA batching 11-22 obsidian well</p>

<p>-Wolf creek pig sent at 10:10, liquids arrived at 11:20, only 17m3 of liquids, done slugging at 12:40.&nbsp; Pig seemed better than normal, perhaps additional volume keeps line swept of fluid.&nbsp; Pig is pulled.</p>

<p>-Lower glycol flashtank level a bit</p>

<p>-C3 single speed fan off, 2 speed on slow</p>

<p>-Shut down K-201 when taking pig, didn&#39;t have much extra gas, left K-201 down as it is probably not needed.&nbsp; Can be fired up if need be.</p>

<p>-Bad valves on K-205 cylinder 1.&nbsp; Shut down and LOTO, use 204 as sales, everything back to normal after Clayton changed valves</p>

<p>-Regen tops temp TIC 4300 from 39.5% to 41%</p>

<p>-LOTO P-3401 B LPG pump and Clayton and Tyson changed packing.&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">Job not completed at shift change, will need to extend permit.&nbsp; </span></p>
