<p>Weather clear and cold -30</p>

<p>Opened up sour inlets at the header.</p>

<p>Swung 1-21 out of V-3101 and back into V-200</p>

<p>Clayton started working on K-206 bearing. He will finish it off tomorrow.</p>

<p>Acid gas line pressure increasing with no reason. All valves and ESD&#39;S are open to the well. Suspect that fuel gas was injected down the well pressuring it up.</p>

<p>Lost BC3 on lubricator no flo. Restarted.</p>

<p>Shut in sour wells into V-200</p>

<p>Shut off the acid gas compressor due to high discharge pressure.</p>

<p>Lowered the regen tops temp to help reduce reflux accumulator level. Controler TIC 4300 is in manual.</p>

<p>Closed louvers on the amine cooler.</p>

<p>Called Pembina control to start shipping, pumped 38 m3 before they shut down on low density.</p>
