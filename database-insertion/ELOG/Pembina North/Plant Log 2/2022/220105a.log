========================================
<p>Weather at the start of shift cold, cloudy -28 staying that temp throughout the day.</p>

<p>The hot oil heater went down 2 times on flame fail, adjusted the air intake heat control valve manually to cool the air down, temp control running between 19 and 29 degrees.</p>

<p>Production books sales gas in inlet volumes were not balanced. Found that fqi 99 meter was over ranging on DP and not always reading the correct volume. Increased the back pressure control on fqi 99 to 910kpa to 950 kpa to help force more gas through fqi 3008 meter.</p>

<p>Increased K204 speed 50 rpm to move more gas.</p>

<p>Vermillian called and said that maybe Thrusday night or Friday they will be temporarily shutting off the extra gas to run tubing down the well.</p>

<p>Tyson out to take oil samples</p>

<p>Nathan grease the BC3 motor</p>
