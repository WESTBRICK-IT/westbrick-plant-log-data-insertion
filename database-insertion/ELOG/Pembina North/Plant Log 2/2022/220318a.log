========================================
<p>Weather at the start of shift clear +9 cooling down to -2</p>

<p>Plant still down at shift change, circulating amine but no compression yet started.</p>

<p>Mechanics finished up on the c3 speed fan bearings</p>

<p>K205 having lube issues, Clayton repaired lube block blockage.</p>

<p>7pm started up all compression and started bring gas into the plant.</p>

<p>Called all the producers to let them know that plant was back up.</p>

<p>Plant down on lel in process, 3 heads rang in high and quicky cleared. Checked area out and found nothing for leaks. Lost c3, hot oil heater, Volcanoe boiler, all inlets closed.</p>

<p>Restarted and monitored.</p>

<p>Tyson found a loose brace on the c3 first stage scrubber bottle causing high vibration and noise. Tighteded back up and vibration and noise went away.</p>

<p>Tried restarting the Volcano boiler but it kept shutting down on high fuel gas pressue. Summited a servicre request #6051744</p>

<p>Completed a slips and trips inspecftion</p>

========================================
<p>weather: +7 and sunny</p>

<p>-V-200 not pumping fluid, got the pump working and pulled down line pack</p>

<p>-P-5000 acid gas first stage pump not working.&nbsp; Breaker had tripped, reset and been fine since</p>

<p>-regen tops temp controller from 36 to 37% as we weren&#39;t making reflux</p>

<p>-Lots off issues with De-eth reflux issues in the morning, was getting high level, then when we got wolf creek pig De-eth tower filled up and also filled up de-bute tower.&nbsp; Had to nurse so temp controllers and level controllers but has been fine since</p>

<p>-Methanol pump was vapour locked and not pumping, back online</p>

<p>-Debute was&nbsp;getting high pressure and relieving to flare with only 1 fan working.&nbsp; Adjusted louver control from 900 to 800 kpa, cooler bypass pic-3105B from 850 to 800, fan speed at 90%, seems to maintain pressure now</p>

<p>-Devin fixed volcano boiler issues.&nbsp; Fuel gas valve was opening too quickly and sending too much fuel, tuned valve and boiler is fine now, decreasing glycol temp a little bit with the warmer weather now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Nathan working on installing new VFD for second debute fan</p>

<p>-Acid gas packing vent pump not working, tried starting multiple times and switching breaker.&nbsp; Had Nathan check on it briefly but he will have to dig deeper into it, so he kept working on the VFD.</p>

<p>-C3 condenser 2 speed fan on slow and single speed fan on</p>

<p>-Pembina proving the meter</p>
