========================================

<p>-morning meeting</p>

<p>-add C3 to system from 1 bolt to 8 bolts in accumulator, updated chemical logs</p>

<p>-Talked to Devin about orifice plates for bringing on new Westbrick gas.&nbsp; Figured v-3101 might be alright.&nbsp; Says we can verify once gas shows up</p>

<p>-5-21 batched and pigged today, chad pulled pigs when he was done with splitter line so he could take them</p>

<p>-spitter line batched and pigged from site to 7-22</p>

<p>-safety meeting today</p>

<p>-Devin cleaning humidifier for sales H2S analyzer</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Westbrick was planning to send new well to us today down the 14-3 line.&nbsp; Testing shows 140 e3m3 and 48m3 of condy.&nbsp; Might have to send more gas from v-101 to K-204 and make some room in K-203 and may need to adjust K-206 let down to MP for K-202.&nbsp; If v-101 to K-204 meter FQI-3008 is overranging there should be a valve to open downstream of FQI-99 to send more flow to K-204 instead of K-203.&nbsp; Will have to watch tank levels as Pembina is not shipping and we may have an additional 48m3 from Westbrick well.&nbsp; There is potential for them to tank on site if we get in a jam.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>-Work on some LOTO packages</p>

<p>-lower glycol flash tank level a bit, was just below 3 bolts after</p>

<p>-snug glycol pump packing a bit</p>
