========================================
<p>Weather patrly cloudy +22</p>

<p>Blue River Trucking delivered 1 load of Zeta water</p>

<p>Water plant shut down on high discharge pressure, waited for the pressure to drop and reset the plant.</p>

<p>The lean side of the amine exchanger started plugging off again and starving the booster pump for suction. Decided to do a back flush with fuel gas back through to the amine skim tank. Shut in sour inlets and shut off the charge pump to do the flush. The pump would not start up when done causing amine to sour up.</p>

<p>Lost K-205 compressor when sour, sales analyzer got as high as 20 ppm&#39;s, decided to pull back from sales until sweet. When sweet, opened up all the plant inlets and started selling again.</p>

<p>Shut off the amine 2 speed fan.</p>
