========================================
<p>Weather cold -22</p>

<p>At start of shift Rpm just finished pumping in 3m3 of methanol down the acid gas well</p>

<p>Started the acid gas compressor and tried pushing the methanol with acid gas. Tried all night to with the compressor but ran into high pipeline pressure.</p>

<p>At 4:30 am Westbrick well went down and lost 90% of the plant inlet. Called Wazzy to let him know but he was already on his way out.</p>

<p>K-206 went down on low suction. Restarted and opened the manual bypass to keep running.</p>

<p>Tightened the packing on the north glycol pump.</p>

<p>Lost the acid gas compressor several times throughout the night.</p>
