========================================
<p>Weather +9 at the start of shift cooling down to 0</p>

<p>Called Pembina control to start up pumps, went down again on low density</p>

<p>Equalized fluid out of the production tank back to the overflow tank to get rid of some volume in the procuction tank.</p>

<p>Found that the dump valve on V-101 was open and dumping gas to the treater, the valve was showing closed on the dcs. Called Shawn Dittner out he pulled the valve apart and he didnt really find much wrong except there was a travel block that was hand tight</p>

<p>and it wasnt allowing the valve to open or close. Valve is working fine now.</p>
