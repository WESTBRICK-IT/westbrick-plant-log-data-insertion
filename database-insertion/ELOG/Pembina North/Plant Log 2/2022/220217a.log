<p>Weather: +3, some snow and rain</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Please watch footing as snow, rain, and warm temps have made things slippery</span></p>

<p>-Morning meeting</p>

<p>-AC-3102A debute fan from 0 to 10%</p>

<p>-C3 2 speed fan turned from slow to fast</p>

<p>-TIC 4300 regen tops temp adjusted from 39 to 39.5%</p>

<p>-accountability framework session</p>

<p>-fix some production books for Jessica</p>

<p>-Increased lubrication drip rates for LPG pump</p>

<p>-Talked to Pembina, we should be back shipping on saturday evening</p>

<p>-Westbrick brought on production from new well 16-3-50-14.&nbsp; Right now we are about 110e3m3 up through v-3101.&nbsp; This is backing out the inlets to v-3101.&nbsp; Following changes have been made to try and move more gas</p>

<ul>
	<li>k-203 RPM from 670 to 880</li>
	<li>K-204 RPM from 850 to 880</li>
	<li>K-206 RPM from 840 to 870</li>
	<li>K-205 from 780 to 830</li>
	<li>BPY-101 back pressure controller from v-101 to K-203 set from 850 to 910 kpa to try and force more gas to K-204 and free up some room with K-203</li>
	<li>Reinstated alarms and S/D&#39;s for K-201 and started compressor to see if that will help pull down more pressure, doesn&#39;t appear to have made much of a difference, may be able to shut compressor down tonight</li>
	<li>Talked to Mark S in the field about the pressure.&nbsp; 14-3 pressure went from roughly 1000 kpa to 1900 kpa with start up of the well, but our inlets went from 680 kpa to 780 kpa.&nbsp; seemed like a big spread between the two, but Mark hit all the riser sites and pressures seem to drop in a fairly linear fashion between 14-3 and our inlets.&nbsp; Perhaps this is just the way the line will look with the extra gas.&nbsp; The extra 40m3 of fluid in the line potentially causing some fluid pack issues?&nbsp; We will see how things level out.&nbsp; All compression is on and sped up and no recycle valves open on compression.&nbsp; Don&#39;t seem to be moving as much gas as we should be able to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>-hot oil pump seal leak is about the same</p>
