<p>-No security issues noted at Braz</p>

<p>-Get info from acid gas injection from the last year and send off to Kelly</p>

<p>-K-203 louvers from 36 to 38 to warm up contactor inlet a bit</p>

<p>-do timesheets</p>

<p>-recycling from overflow tank as well as production now, sped up recycle B from 50 to 70m3/day</p>

<p>-Add N2 to V-200 barrier fluid, N2 bottle will need changed soon</p>

<p>-Dump K-203 scrubber and K-202 2nd stage scrubber</p>

<p>-Sullair vent to outside closed up to try and warm up inside the building</p>

<p>-adjust LPG lube rates as oil is thicker with the cold weather</p>

<p>-Add C3 to system from 2 bolts to 8 bolts, swap propane tanks as south tank is empty</p>

<p>-AC-3102 A debute fan from 5% to 0%</p>

<p>-drain horizontal coalescer</p>

<p>-no glycol in the flash tank, stroke dump valve a couple times, and adjusted the level controller, level at 3 bolts now</p>

<p>-lost glycol level when flows dropped, glycol level is steady, but have not gained glycol back yet, keep an eye on level.&nbsp; Added a little glycol from overhead tank around 3:30, level went from 55 to 80% with only a couple seconds of adding, dropped back down to 55% over the next hour</p>

<p>-Amine regen reflux flow looked like it dropped off a lot on January 30th morning, i didn&#39;t see much else change at that time.&nbsp; Maybe meter issues?&nbsp;</p>
