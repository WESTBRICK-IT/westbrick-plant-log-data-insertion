<p>Weather clear -2 in the monring warming to +11 in the afternoon</p>

<p>Clayton and Apecs worked on K-204 overhaul</p>

<p>Called Pembina control in the am to try pumping, it went down shortly after on low density.</p>

<p>Equalized a bunch of oil from the production tank to the overflow.</p>

<p>Orientated a Giff Trucking service driver</p>

<p>Input Giff trucking into the truck in meter at the #11 slot</p>

<p>Giff unload 1 load of Vermillian(Westbrick) 16-36-55-15 w/5 emulsion into the overflow tank. The density was over .820 so should help with the pembina density issues.</p>

<p>Swung recycle b pump into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Added C3 to the surge tank</p>

<p>Dump lube oil from the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Amine concentration 37%</p>

<p>Both Pat and Blaine did their fit and hearing tests at Cynthia plant.</p>
