========================================
<p>Weather: -23 degrees, some minor snoe, then clear up throughout the night</p>

<p>-no security issues noted at Braz North</p>

<p>-Add C3 to system, stopped at 6 bolts as should get additional C3 from chiller, updated chemical log</p>

<p>-Chiller level back down to 12% from 21%</p>

<p>-Finish opening inlets and place back in auto.&nbsp; Couldn&#39;t open v-207 as the separator built up fluid and wouldn&#39;t dump.&nbsp; Have been trying to find blockage in line with baker pump and methanol.</p>

<p>-debute fans from 75% down to 0%</p>

<p>-Flows low through plant, slow down and recycle K-203 and K-204.&nbsp; Left compressors running as Vermilion plans to flow new well to us again in the morning.</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Regen tops temp TIC-4300 set from 37% to 34% as flows through plant are low</span></p>

<p>-GC trouble status rang in a couple times, but no alarms on GC when i went out to look at it</p>

<p>-opened door from annex into sales analyzer to try and warm up the analyzer room</p>

<p>-sped up K-202 a bit to help pull pressure off v-200, slowed down after.</p>

<p>-had to clean treater exchanger basket twice</p>

<p>-watch Zeta board while kyle was there as his tablet comms were not working</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Purchase request #10018106 entered for midwest propane delivery</span></p>

<p>-tried to dump horizontal coalescer, but couldn&#39;t get it to dump, will have to investigate what is going on there</p>

<p>-water flash tank has lower pressure than usual, probably low from plant outage.&nbsp; pressure control valve is closed, cycled it a few times.&nbsp; Should get pressure increase when more product ends up there.</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Event #23739 entered for K-3301B 1st stage PSV failure.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-Recycle pump B pulling out of overflow tank.&nbsp; Used truck offload valve as overflow valve seems blocked.&nbsp; Please swing out of overflow tank around 9am.&nbsp; Do not keep pump recycling from tank as we have Zeta condy in there.</span></p>

<p>-was able to free up v-207 dump line around 3am, started opening up flow to vessel again, back in auto</p>

<p>-pumped out acid gas flare knockout to help build pressure of water flash tank, pumped out other flare knockout a little bit but pump only run for a little then stop, will try some more tomorrow.&nbsp; Water flash tank pressure came up a bit after dumping acid gas flare knockout</p>

<p>-plugged hole in flare header building floor to hold heat in better</p>

<p>-V-101 showing flow to K-204 even though K-204 is isolated.&nbsp; FQI 3008 seems to be a little frozen up.&nbsp; Tried blowing it down a bunch.&nbsp; 1 side is free and the other is a little obstructed.&nbsp; heat trace works, may need to wrapped with snake wrap.</p>
