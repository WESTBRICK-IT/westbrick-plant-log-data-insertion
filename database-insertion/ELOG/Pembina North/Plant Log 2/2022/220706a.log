<p>Weather sunny +20</p>

<p>Duvera crew finished up around 6 pm</p>

<p>Pumped out the process floor drains</p>

<p>Lowered the level in the glycol flash tank</p>

<p>Cut a couple of degrees temp out of the glycol reboiler to try and help out with returns. Thinking that it was steam vapour locked in the still colume.</p>
