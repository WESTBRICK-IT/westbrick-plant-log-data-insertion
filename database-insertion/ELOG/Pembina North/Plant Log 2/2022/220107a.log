========================================
<p>Weather: -27, minor snow in early morning</p>

<p>-no security issues noted for Braz North</p>

<p>-C3 flaring on shift handover, losing all the propane, added a little bit so we could fire up to troubleshoot issue, found issues to be 1st stage discharge PSV bypassing.&nbsp; Shut down compressor</p>

<ul>
	<li>Blow down and LOTO k-3301B to remove PSV</li>
	<li>Kelly did a lot of calling around and talked to Rocky Mountain Valve to service and repair PSV for tomorrow</li>
	<li>Removed PSV with Kyle.&nbsp; We will meet Kelly in town in the morning to give him PSV to run to Rocky</li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">Called both Midwest and Superior to schedule delivery of propane for tomorrow, couldn&#39;t get ahold of anyone.&nbsp; Left message for superior to call us back, Midwest had no voice mail.&nbsp; Might be worth calling both places again in the morning to see who can deliver the quickest. </span></li>
	<li>Added C3 to surge tank up to 12 bolts to prepare for start up.</li>
	<li>hoping to get propane delivery folks to directly into chiller and fill with liquid propane, but will have to see what they can do tomorrow</li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">1 tank of propane is empty, the other is around 50%</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">- Process H2S analyzer still bypassed, doesn&#39;t mean much with the plant down right now</span></p>

<p>-called producers to inform them of our outage</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kim with obsidian</li>
	<li>sid with white cap</li>
	<li>John with Vermilion</li>
	<li>Terry with Vermilion (new drill)</li>
	<li>Randy with Vermilion</li>
	<li>Wozy with westbrick</li>
	<li>Talked to Mark Spelrem so he knew what was up incase and producers called him</li>
	<li>Phone numbers should be in my book if anyone needs</li>
</ul>

<p>-closed inlets manual 0% as well as ESD&#39;s onm v-3101, v-200, v-207, v-101, v-104</p>

<p>-shut off glycol pump</p>

<p>-debute fans from 0 to 75%</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-acid gas pipeline start up bypass on to prevent mode 1 if pressure drops too low</span></p>

<p>-didn&#39;t get to recycle water off bottom of overflow tank yet</p>

<p>-regen tops temp would not steady out, has been up too high and down too low, TIC 4300 down to 24% from 35%, <span style="color:#FF0000">please be aware of potential for little burps of sour on start up with the up and down regen tops temp</span></p>

<p>-did envirosoft entry for the total flare volume from yesterday</p>

<p>-K-202 would not stay running as it doesn&#39;t have quality recycle control and just wanted to move gas, but building is warm so not big concern</p>
