========================================
<p>Weather: 4 degrees, sunny</p>

<p>-K-204 down, couldn&#39;t get it running, waited until clayton showed up.&nbsp; Found issues with dirty pickups on the flywheel.&nbsp; cleaned and fired back up</p>

<p>-open some doors and windows throughout plant</p>

<p>-K-203 top and bottom louvers from 37 to 34 degrees</p>

<p>-Issues with P-3501B pump shaft.&nbsp; Has some play, running it will eventually cause seal issues again.&nbsp; The pump it unlocked and valves open and we ran it to make sure everything was fine. Will keep this down and can use as a spare if needed.&nbsp; Will continue to run P-3501A</p>

<p>-Tic-4300 regen tops temp from 37% to 38.5% to keep temps up due to P-3501A hot oil pump running</p>

<p>-K-204 went down in the afternoon again with the same pick-up issues on the flywheel.&nbsp; Clayton replaced both pickups and fired back up, hopefully this should fix the issue.</p>

<p>-clean treater exchanger basket strainer.&nbsp; right full or dry wax.</p>
