<p>Weathe hot +32</p>

<p>K204 down at shift change from high compressor oil temp. Left down for 30 minutes and restarted and left rpm set for 650</p>

<p>Dumped lube oil from the chiller de-oiler</p>

<p>Sped up compression when ambiant cooled off.</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS</p>

<p>The amine charge pump starting ringing in on low suction, found the booster pump losing suction pressure slowly causing the charge pump to shut down temporarily. Tried swapping booster pumps but still doing it. Still trouble shooting at shift change.Suspect the y-strainers upstream of the plate exchanger are plugging off.</p>

<p>Lost the amine charge pump on vfd fault at shift change. Reset the vfd and it restarted. Shut in V-200 inlet until problem fixed.</p>

<p>Lost the acid gas compressor.</p>
