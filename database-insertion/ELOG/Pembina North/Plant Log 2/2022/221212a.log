========================================
<p>Weather sunny cold -12 for a high</p>

<p>Production tank level at 07:00 was 3.4 meters, confirmed with the temp gun.</p>

<p>Wolf Creek pigged</p>

<p>K-206 compressor down 1 time on low suction.</p>

<p>K-5000 Acid gas compressor down on low suction</p>

<p>PPM&#39;S on both analyzers started to climb.</p>

<p>Shut in PNA and WPNA headers to help with the high h2s. When ppm&#39;s lowered we opened up on the sour inlets</p>

<p>Increased the amine regen tops setpoint to 102 from 101 degrees. This should help with stream traffic in the amine regen and create more reflux.</p>

<p>Amine concentration at 42%</p>

<p>Raised the amine makeup water to 25% from 15%</p>

<p>Ordered amine makeup water to be delivered tomorrow.</p>

<p>Davita on site building scaffolding on the hot oil heater exhaust stack to drill holes in stack tomorrow.</p>

<p>Keltec on site working on radio communication.</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol flash tank</p>

========================================
<p>Weather is cold -20 c</p>

<p>tank level at 7pm 3.02 confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>Slowed down the Amine makeup water pump from 25 to 15</p>

<p>Chase down some numbers on the fuel gas to the hot oil heater</p>

<p>dec 24/2021 the heater used 9 e3m3 a day for almost two weeks as it was repaired by the heat tech</p>

<p>After the heater was repaired from a cold heater to up to temp it took right around 10e3m3 for that day&nbsp;</p>

<p>14-03 esd closed at 2am texted the westbrick operator(wazzie) he will go get it running</p>

<p>lost K206&nbsp; started her back up and open the manual bypass</p>

<p>Slowed down the glycol pumps dropped it 10%( fic 3012)</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor is ringing in on low suction pressure.</p>

<p>Cut back V200 to 25% on the inlet as our ppm was climbing above 3,25 ppm</p>

<p>started to open up v200 again</p>

<p>ramp up the glycol flow again as we have good gas flow through the plant</p>
