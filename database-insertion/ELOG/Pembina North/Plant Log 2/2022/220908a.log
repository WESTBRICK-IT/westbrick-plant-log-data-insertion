<p>Weather: +19 at the start of shift cooling to +7 in the morning</p>

<p>2 Power bumps knocked down the hot oil heater C3 and water plant.&nbsp; Went to reset the power on the C3 comp and the Multilin was flashing.&nbsp; Called out Mark to take a look.&nbsp; Did a reset on it and got the C3 back up and running.</p>

<p>Lost cameras at Pem and Braz during the poer flick, called out Daren and he got them reset and working again.</p>

<p>Adjust the debute fan (slowed)</p>

<p>Played with the glycol going to the still column, left it going into the regen barrel.</p>

<p>PPL shut down on high BS&amp;W.&nbsp; Equalized about a meter from the shipping tank bottoms to the overflow tank.&nbsp; Called PPL to start in the morning and still shipping at shift change.</p>

<p>Asked PPL to have someone check the probe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sped up recycle from 80m3/d to 120m3/d.&nbsp; Should recycle slowly out of the Overflow tank if decide to do so.</p>
