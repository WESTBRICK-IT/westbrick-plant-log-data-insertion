<p>Decreased the amine water makeup to 10% from 15%</p>

<p>Jason with Hi Flo called and he will be here tomorrow to prove the Keyline meter.</p>

<p>Mark S pigged the Wolf Creek line, Lots of liquids with icey sludge flooded out V- 3101 and causing the level transmitters to read wrong and plug off the liquid meter. Pumped methanol into the ystrainer before the meter.</p>

<p>Pulled the Wolf Creek pig, lots of hydrate material in the pig reciever. Mark has been notified and they will pig again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Changed the amine bag fliter.</p>

<p>Added barrier fluid to V-200 pump</p>

<p>Clayton looked at the west flare ko pump and figured it was okay and we might have a restriction downstream of the pump to the boot.</p>

<p>Called Rob Thirsk and ordered methanol, he will deliver tomorrow.</p>
