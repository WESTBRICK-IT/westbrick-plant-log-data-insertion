<p>- Skimmed the amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>- Chad pigged 14-03 and Dominion pipelines, pigs are pulled and clean.</p>

<p>-<strong> Chad would like to pig 1-21 in the plant tomorrow morning sometime, notified Obsidian operator (Kim) that we will be shutting in 1-21 for a few hours to pressure it up.</strong></p>

<p>- <strong>Jordan with Baker Hughes will be out tomorrow with a bulk truck to deliver chemical.</strong></p>

<p>- Turned on the 2-Speed C3 condenser fan to slow.</p>

<p>- Called Pembina to start our pump at 4:30PM, it went down on density at 4:50PM.</p>

<p>- Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the production tank and increased the speed of recycle pump &quot;A&quot; to 100m3/day from 70m3/day.</p>

<p>- Turned on the 2-Speed amine bulk cooler fan to &quot;Slow&quot;.</p>

<p>- Increased the level in the chiller from 13% to 13.5% to try and get the differential temp back on spec.</p>
