<p>Weather cloudy -8 snowing on and off throughout the day</p>

<p>Worked on safety checks</p>

<p>Amine concentration 36%</p>

<p>Tightened the packings on the EG pump</p>

<p>Filled the lpg pump lubricator and changed out the 45 gallon barrel for a full one</p>

<p>Mark Pigged 14-3 again today, not as much ice in the receiver as the other days but it carry a bunch of slush into V-3101 causing level transmitters to read incorrect and plug off the liquid dump through the meter.</p>

<p>Pumped a little more out of the flare ko.Still very cold liquids and could be slush .</p>
