<p>Nathan got power back to the acid gas packing vent pump breaker. Pump working fine.</p>

<p>Pembina called to say they shut their pumps down because of to low of density, increased both recycle pumps to the treater to 65% output from 50%. Will get dayshift to try again in the morning.</p>

<p>Slowed the debuted fan speed down to 10% from 50%</p>

<p>Weather: +10</p>

<p>-Pembina shut us in on low density, talked to Kelly and Raymond, they figure things will get better with obsidian production on again.&nbsp; We can try and call Pembina tonight to see if density is high enough to run</p>

<p>-increase recycle pump speed to try and flash more off our condy to increase density</p>

<p>-pull 11-22 plunger lift to flare to get plunger to surface, plunger came up</p>

<p>-wolf creek line pigged.&nbsp; 20m3 slug, pulled and clean, had to turn methanol on while dumping</p>

<p>-work on weekend checks</p>

<p>-drain coalescer and de-eth overheadsscrubber</p>

<p>-c3 2 speed fan slow and single speed on</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-HVO to truck in a load of mancal oil around 5 am</span></p>

<p>-treater gas off meter rang in on high diff pressure, slowed down recycle pumps to lower gas breakout in treater</p>
