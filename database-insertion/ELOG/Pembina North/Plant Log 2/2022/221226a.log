========================================
<p>Weather was warm and clear</p>

<p>Tank level was 2.88 and confirmed with a temp gun</p>

<p>called pembina pipeline to try our pump,we are still too light on the density</p>

<p>Kelly called to ask about the shipping oil , told him pembina still isn&#39;t taking our product . He called the producers to get some trucks to haul out some oil.</p>

<p>Rpm pressure truck out to pump some methanol into the flowline of the acid gas ,we displaced the flow line with 1.5m3 ,pumping from the wellhead side to the acid gas flow line to flare knockout, we couldn&#39;t push through the coriolis meter,we had to tie in upstream of the meter to fill the flowline, after it was displaced&nbsp; then we pumped 1.5m3 into the tubing .After pumping into the wellhead the tubing pressure dropped to 3500 kpa .I then strated the compressor and open the flowline to the wellhead .the compressor pressured up to 11000 kpa within the first five mins of running .called blain asked for some advice and without being here its tough to trouble shoot .I the called kelly to let him know of the status of the well .he asked if i could shut her down at this point ,</p>

<p>Mark will be here tomorrow to start the ground disturbance for the domestic well</p>

<p>H2S analizer in process is still giving faluse readings and is bypassed .ientered a WO for this yesterday</p>

<p>Sour water flash tank L2 controller isn&#39;t keeping enough pressure on the tank , needed to open to flare to drain some off .I put in a WO 6065000</p>

========================================
<p>Weather warming to 0 overnight.</p>

<p>Forced the inlet esd open on to V-104 to be able to crack open the inlet control valve to buildup enough DP to dump to the treater. Back to normal.</p>

<p>Lost K-202 compressor on low suction. Restarted ran good.</p>

<p>Tightened the packings on the north EG pump</p>

<p>The plant EG flow bounceing all over the place, tried run control in manual but it still would flow properly, tried blowing down the meter manifold valve but still no luck. Running the presssure control in manual to control the flow.</p>

<p>Work ordered the glcol flow control.</p>

<p>Bled the sensing line down to the process analyzer, got alot of liquids out of the tubing line. That seems to have helped out, the ppm&#39;s are not bouncing around like before.</p>

<p>Filled one of the air packs in the control room.</p>

<p>Opened up the louvers a little on the amine cooler.</p>
