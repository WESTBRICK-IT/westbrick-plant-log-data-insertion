========================================
<p>Weather: +16, overcast/ sunny mix</p>

<p>-Morning meeting</p>

<p>-Called Stetsons to book night shift truck in for recall.&nbsp; No available appointments until wednesday or thursday next week.&nbsp; Will let next shift make plans.&nbsp; seems like it will be a quick visit just to check and see if front middle seatbelt is connected.</p>

<p>-C3 condenser single speed fan on and 2 speed fan fast</p>

<p>-Nathan working on H2S head for flare knockout building</p>

<p>-Sure point on site to scope out air conditioning upgrades in MCC&#39;s, did orientation for Riley</p>

<p>-Knocked down K-205 and swung K-204 in sales mode.&nbsp; Clayton was checking out pyro issues with K-205 and fixing idle linkage.&nbsp; Found about 5 bad and cracked leads, replaced leads and changed all spark plugs.&nbsp; Brought back online and put K-204 back to v-101 suction. Issues with 2 pyros on K-205 still, different pyros then before.&nbsp; Clayton figures its just not enough load on the compressor</p>

<p>-Devin adjusted some louvers on K-203 and K-204</p>

<p>-Had Devin look at and snug up glycol line on K-204, small drip out of tubing threads, looks good now, keep an eye on it</p>

<p>-found some piping vibrating and wearing through by cooler bank on K-204, notified Kelly.&nbsp; Upon further investigation could see that one line was fuel gas shut off valve and was open to atmosphere, and the other line was a disconnected 1/2 inch line going to cooler bank accross the road, neither line has pressure on them and pulled apart 1/2 inch line to avoid further damage</p>

<p>-talked to orest about K-206 nipple failure a few weeks ago to get volume released figured out</p>
