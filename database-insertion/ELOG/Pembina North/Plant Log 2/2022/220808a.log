========================================
<p>Weather sunny +22</p>

<p>BC3 still down at shift change</p>

<p>Nathan, Mark Steinberg and Daren found the source of the smoke with the c3 compressor breaker, change out with new part and tried restarting the compressor but it would not run. Tried a couple of times and but there was something tripping a relay.</p>

<p>Around 9 pm it was decided to shut in the plant and call producers called Kim B with Obsidean, Wazzy with Westbrick, Randy with Vermillian (780-898-3716) and Terranace with Vermillian (780-621-1072)</p>

<p>All compressors are down and depressured</p>

<p>Glycol is shut down</p>

<p>All inlet control valves are manual closed.</p>
