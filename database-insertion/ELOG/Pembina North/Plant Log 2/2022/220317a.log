========================================
<p>Weather: +9, mix of cloudy and sunny</p>

<p>-Schneider electric on site to replace amine main breaker</p>

<p>-During job prep it was found that we would lose additional equipment with amine breaker swap.&nbsp; Decision made to go with a full plant outage</p>

<p>-Called producers to inform them of outage.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Terence with Vermillion</li>
	<li>Derek with Westbrick</li>
	<li>Sid with Whitecap</li>
	<li>Vern with Baccalieau</li>
	<li>Kim with obsidian</li>
	<li>Dave with Ridgeback</li>
	<li>Dalton with Vermillion</li>
	<li><span style="color:#FF0000">Please call producers when we are starting to get flows through the plant (numbers are in my logbook)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>-Equipment that was shut down as follows</p>

<ul>
	<li>Amine charge pump</li>
	<li>Amine booster pump</li>
	<li>Amine reflux pump</li>
	<li>RO make-up water pump</li>
	<li>Rich amine valve closed from contactor to flash tank</li>
	<li>Acid gas compressor down for service.&nbsp; Pipeline bypass timer is active until we get our line pressure back to normal, then bypass can be removed</li>
	<li>K-202, K-203, K-204, K-205, K-206 compressors down</li>
	<li>Inlet&#39;s ESD&#39;d and manual 0 for control valves</li>
	<li>C3 compressor down</li>
	<li>Glycol pumps off</li>
	<li>H-400 hot oil heater down</li>
	<li>Both recycle pumps are off</li>
	<li>de-eth reflux pump</li>
	<li>de-butanizer reflux pump</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">-We can start increasing amine concentration to 40% as per Kelly</span></p>

<p>-Isolate V-101 and depressure, pull high level switch, full of wax, cleaned and re-installed</p>

<p>-Mechanics did service on K-5000, then started cooler fan inspections.&nbsp; Found issues with C3 condensor 2 speed fan, currently locked out and replacing bearings</p>

<p>-K-206 engine oil temp sensor was fixed</p>

<p>-Daren worked on ESD checks while facility down</p>

<p>-Devin&nbsp;went and looked as some greenpath leak detection checks</p>

<p>-Issues with couplers on K-205 lube pump on startup, mechanics working on it. all fixed up</p>

<p>-Issues with getting air to pre lube pump on K-203 on start up, instrumentation fixed it up</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Thank you to everyone for the hard work today!</p>
