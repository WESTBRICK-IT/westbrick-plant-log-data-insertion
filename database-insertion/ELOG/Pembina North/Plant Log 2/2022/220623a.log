<p>- Blew down horizontal coalescer.</p>

<p>- Amine trim cooler and O/H condenser aftercooler temperatures were bouncing up and down rapidly causing the louvers and motor speeds to jump up and down, notified Devin and he will take a look at it when he is in today, had to run the fans and louvers in manual for a bit,<br />
&nbsp; it seemed to have smartened up around midnight, all back in auto at shift change.</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Lowered the level in the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>- Checked on de-eth O/H methanol pump a few times, all good.</p>

<p>- Added oil to K-204 engine, 30 -&gt; 55% in the sight glass.</p>

<p>- Turned off the C3 single speed condenser fan, 2-Speed on &quot;Fast&quot;.</p>

<p>- No security issues noted at Braz North.</p>
