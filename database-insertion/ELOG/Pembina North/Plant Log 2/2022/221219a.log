========================================
<p>Weather was cold and windy -29&nbsp;to -33 ambient</p>

<p>Tank level at 07:00 on DCS was 3.12&nbsp;and verfied with temp gun</p>

<p>Bolt for K-203 support bracket on the Southeast side on the gas line that crosses under the stairs was broken. Hazard ID entered and Clayton took a look. Vibirations were low so no concern.</p>

<p>Tested for sour under air. KPA Injected&nbsp;3 m/3 of methonol to the Acid Gas Injection</p>

<p>Locked out acid gas Injection for wireline hand over. LOTO and isolation form is in Shannons posession at the acid gas injection</p>

<p>14-3 ESD closed after compressor went down on their end. Pumped methonol into system because flow was dropping off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gycol levels dropped due to 14-3 ESD closing so we had to add some from the overhead tank</p>

<p>Drained amine skim tank</p>

<p>Ryan did ADR with Kelly</p>

<p>Checked for WPNE pig but it was not there so Chad and I have&nbsp;to block WPNE in to the plant and bleed it down to 500 KPA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Submitted PR for radio repair to Keltech with quote</p>
