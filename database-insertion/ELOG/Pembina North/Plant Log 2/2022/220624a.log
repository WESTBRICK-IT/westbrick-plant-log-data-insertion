========================================
<p>Weather rainy and cloudy for the most part of the day. High +14</p>

<p>Clayton and Apecs finished up with K-5000 overhaul</p>

<p>A-Team was out and deblinded the K-5000</p>

<p>General Scrap Metal was out and dropped of a new metal bin. The driver tried to pick up the full bin but the ground was to soft from all the rain. They will have to come out once it dry&#39;s out in that area.</p>

<p>Started bringing in sour inlet around 2:30pm, the compressor was running high packing vent pressure and distance peice pressure due to the new packings and seals needing time to seat. If we have issues during the night operations are to give Clayton a call.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delievered 6m3 of amine makeup water from Braz River.</p>

<p>Started on weekend checks</p>

<p>Called Rob Thirsk to let him know we need some secondary containments and process sumps emptied of all the rain water.</p>

<p>Pumped out the amine charge pump packing tank.</p>

<p>Started the c3 single speed fan on and swapped the 2 speed fan to slow.</p>
