<p>tank levels on the PLC 3.32 and with a temp gun 3.30</p>

<p>Mask up and change the amine bag filter</p>

<p>RO water pump was still not pumping so at 10 pm I called a electrican out to check the heat trace. the heat trace was&nbsp; good WO 6064255</p>

<p>We installed a gauge in the line to see what the pump was pushing out.</p>
