========================================
<p>&nbsp;sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>V-200 inlet controllers back in auto after being shut in</p>

<p>PPL down at 21:10 on density</p>

<p>moved both recycle pumps to the production tank</p>

<p>Called PPL to start pumps around midnight, pumps down on density again at 1:30</p>

<p>PPL back on at 4:45, density dropping again.&nbsp; Slowed down VFD on both recycle pumps to see if less recycle will cool liquids and help with pembina issues.&nbsp; PPL ran fine on -20c night, but shutting down on these warm nights.</p>
