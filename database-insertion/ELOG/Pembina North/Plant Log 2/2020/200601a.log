========================================
<p>Shut plant down this AM after 7-11 splitter valve was open to Braz North. Flipped the spec blind to the closed position and replaced the ball valve (WPNE V-107 valve at splitter line in pipe rack).</p>

<p>Got spool installed to offload Mancal production previously in V-107 into the V-200 line and flow backwards to the 5-14 line to Zeta Creek.</p>

<p>Started plant back up and started offloading to Zeta Creek. Keep in mind controls and shutdowns have not changed for this offload.</p>

<p>Keabray added an new valve on the manual chiller hot gas bypass line.</p>

<p>Hooked up methanol tank and pump to pump into the 5-14 line to Zeta Creek. Pump is maxed out at 60 L per day. Added 1% corrosion inhibitor to methanol.</p>

<p>checked on methanol rates to Bigoray. One pump was down. Got back up and running. Air oil added to air line.</p>

<p>Rob with GGT offloading Zeta Creek water and sucking out secondaries.</p>

<p>Apecs on site working on the c3 compressor.</p>
