========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Swapped the 2 speed c3 condensor fan to slow from fast.</p>

<p>-Added glycol to K-203 overhead tank</p>

<p>-Added oil to lpg pump lubricator.</p>

<p>-Swung recycle b pump out of the overflow tank into the production tank.</p>

<p>-Drove to Braz and help trouble shoot K-101 flaring issues.</p>

<p>-Tightened the packings on the North eg pump.</p>

<p>-K-203 down 4 times, no flag. Replaced #2 Right side plug. Ran good after.</p>

<p>-K202 Down on high liquid level 4th stage. Pumped up the wet leg on the level transmitter with glycol.</p>

========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped inlet coalescer filter.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 to replace&nbsp;3 spark&nbsp;plugs. Tyson also adjusted air fuel ratio to prevent detonation causing plug failure.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Braz North and Zeta Creek water to water plant.</p>

<p>Alex with Core Labs out to take monthly samples.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; to lower contactor inlet temp and surge tank pressure.</p>

<p>Closed one of the sullair compressor exhaust vents to cool down the tempature inside the building.</p>

<p>Sped up debute overhead fan to 100% to lower debute pressure.</p>

<p>Kim with Obsidian pigged 1-21. Comes in slow, will pull tomorrow.</p>

<p>Perry pigged Bigoray to 5-21 then from 5-21 to Pembina North. Took about 4.5 hours. Lots of liquid. Will pull tomorrow.</p>

<p>Pembina control called due to a low density alarm around 775 on their end. Explained that we took a pig and are recycling hard etc. She said she will keep us running as she has noticed our density always climbs back up to around 785 ish after.</p>

<p>V-104, TR-101 and boot flow bosses froze up. FQI-8 (boot) is affecting the other 2 meters. FQI-8 unplugged and will have to continue to be read locally for the book but the other two are now good. Flow boss will be replaced soon.</p>

<p>Raised chiller level to 11% from 10% to chill abit more and tighten up the tempature differential. May need to adjust with gas flows coming down after line pack from pig.</p>

<p>Still manaully pinched on 5-21 inlet due to lots of line pressure. Will need to open up as needed.</p>
