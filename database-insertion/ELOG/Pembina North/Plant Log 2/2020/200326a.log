<p>Top up LPG lubricator</p>

<p>K205 down on compressor oil level. Checked oil level, looked good but S/D still flagged wouldn&#39;t clear. Called Tyson-&nbsp; Recommended to pulled Kenco top off to ensure float was free- was all good.</p>

<p>Call Devin out for K205 Kenco issues. (Follow Covid-19 no contact procedure for additional plant workers.) - Found float working but was coming off of rod that contacts for micro switch. Tightned up and realigned, back in service S/D cleared</p>

<p>Set K204 recycle controller at 725KPA from 800KPA</p>

<p>During K205 being down, unloaded 204, swung into sales mode. Once K205 repaired, compression all back to normal. **Thanks again to Tye for answering a couple questions i had about switch.**</p>

<p>Pull and clean treater exchanger basket. Was right full of solids. BOL</p>

<p>Check 208 scrubbers, we all good. (3rd stg had a little level in it)</p>

<p>Shout out to Dayton for Plowing entire plant- Looks fantastic, Great job!&nbsp; Thanks Dayton!&nbsp;&nbsp; Kyle did ok as well! <img alt="smiley" height="23" src="http://cgymsapp022:8080/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.png" title="smiley" width="23" /></p>
