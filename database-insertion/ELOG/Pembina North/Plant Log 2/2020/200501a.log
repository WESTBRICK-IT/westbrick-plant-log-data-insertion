========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Called into morning&nbsp;meeting.</p>

<p>-Called John with Vermillian to let him know to start up the sweet wells on the wpne line.</p>

<p>-Had a slug of liquids shutting in V-200, the line must have been swept out with the extra gas. Stayed sweet.</p>

<p>-Kyle picked up the empty tidy tank and pump&nbsp;from Zeta and are using it to fill up the methanol tank by the annex instead of getting it trucked in.</p>

<p>-Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>-Sanitized the control room.</p>

<p>-Took water samples, Tye took them into Exova, they are now being sent to Edmonton so the turnaround time will be a little longer.</p>

<p>-Had a slug of liquids into V-101 and V-103, Vermillian must have pigged in the field.</p>
