========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Put the 2 speed c3 condencer/ res gas fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; to lower contactor inlet temp and c3 accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Sped up the debute overhead fans from 40% to 75% to lower the debute pressure.</p>

<p>HP cold sep level was slowy climbing and the valve position was opening further and further. Cycled the methanol and within 2 minuted the level in the HP cold dep dropped. Left the methanol going for 15 minutes and it has maintianed all day.</p>

<p>Checked the glycol concentrations. Lean: 77.8% Rich: 70%. Increased the glycol temp setpoint from 118 degrees to 120 degrees.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>The 7-7 ESD closed lastnight around 6:30 PM where Clearview production ties in. Clearview op called Perry this AM as his feild was down. ESD opened up and flows came back around 6:30 AM. If we loose the 100-150 e3m3 on V-3101 we need to call&nbsp;Keyera on call feild op to ensure that ESD is opened. When Clearview is shut in and the line pressures up it puts that line in the hydrate curve. V-3101 usually&nbsp;flows around 320-350 e3m3.&nbsp;Clearveiw feild op Cliff Ellis 780-898-8176.</p>

<p>Lots of line pack through the day,&nbsp;slowly but surely getting 3101 line pack down.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Added glycol to K-204 expansion tank.</p>

<p>Added speed governor oil to K-203.</p>

<p>Refridge compressor suction valve is pinched back (in auto) due to hi suction pressure from heat. Keep an eye on it once it starts to cool down to ensure the 10&quot; butterfly valve doesnt start to swing.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler.</p>
