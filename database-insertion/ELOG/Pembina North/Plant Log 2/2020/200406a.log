========================================
<p>Rob with GGT will be out tomorrow AM to haul Braz North and Zeta Creek water after he offloads methanol at Zeta Creek.</p>

<p>Called Pembina to see if we reached our noms for the day. They said our noms have been reached at 119.5 m3. Their number rolls over at 07:00 AM and our rolls over at 09:30 AM. They will kick on again at 7 AM.</p>

<p>Equalized the production and overflow tank to lower the level in the production tank to around 3 meters for when Pembina pumps kick on to determine if head pressure is whats effecting their low suction pressure SD. If so, both recycle pumps can be swung back into the overflow tank to build level back up and allow them to pump. Tanks still equalizing at shift change. Dayshift notified.</p>

<p>Worked on CMDS.</p>

<p>Sanitized control Room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Validated Romeo on some CMDS compitencies.</p>
