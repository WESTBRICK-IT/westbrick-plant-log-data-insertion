<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Sped up de bute cooler fan to 70% from 40% to lower debute pressure.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan to fast to lower surge tank pressure and contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-201 and K-202 compressor.</p>

<p>Pulled 1-21 pig.</p>

<p>Cleared the East lubricator line on the LPG pump as it was no longer dripping.</p>

<p>Hi flow will be out tomorrow for Keylink meter prove.</p>

<p>Adjusted recycle louvers on K-201 compressor to lower compressor oil temp and contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Slowed down K-204 from 900 to 840 RPM to lower compressor oil temp. Nightshift, can you speed back up tonight.</p>

<p>Refridge suction valve cut back due to suction pressure. Will have to keep an eye on once it starts cooling down incase that 10&quot; butterfly starts to swing.</p>

<p>Shutdown Volcano boiler and left pumps circulating to cool down. Nightshift, can you shutdown the circ pump once the glycol temp cools down please.</p>
