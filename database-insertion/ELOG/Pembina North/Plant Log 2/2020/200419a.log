========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Weekend checks.</p>

<p>Dumped the berms.</p>

<p>Called a steamer out to free up some culverts. Gate seems to be detached at the LPG culvert as the hand free wheels, Using a trash pump to get the level down.</p>

<p>Nightshift, can you fuel up the trash pump so we can get ahead of the water&nbsp; level at the LPG ditch overnight please.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Zeta water, sucked out floor drains in process, instrument air k/o drum, chiller deoiler and tank 128.</p>

<p>Adjusted K-203 overhead louver linkage at the internal recycle louveres were wide open. Got them adjusted to help cool down the contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan to fast.</p>

<p>Ordered R/O water for 8-9 AM to beat the Tidewater road ban.</p>

<p>Increased amine makeup water rate to maintain reboiler level. From 15% to 17%.</p>

<p>Kim with obsidian pigged 1-21 and PNA.</p>

<p>V-200 started to hi level. Pinched PNA back and brought pig in. Will pull the pigs tomorrow.</p>

<p>Recycled off the boot.</p>

<p>Added oil to speed&nbsp;governor&nbsp;on K-203 compressor.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Opened louvers on K-202 compressor.</p>

<p>Mancal culvert froze by our water injection well. Flowing down and across our raod. Got the steamer to stop by there and clear it while he was out.</p>
