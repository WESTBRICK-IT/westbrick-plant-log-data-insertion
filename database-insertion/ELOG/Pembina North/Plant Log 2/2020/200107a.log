========================================
<p>Rob out this morning to suck out the mass truck in meter so we could remove it. Ran a snake through the meter and didn&#39;t find any blockages, pulled and cleaned the strainer as well.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Braz produced water.</p>

<p>Started K-201 due to K-104 being down at Braz.</p>

<p>Added C3 from 0-7.5 bolts this morning, had Devin pump up the wet leg on the chiller level transmitter, seemed to be reading incorrectly, around 50% in the sight glass was 35% on the transmitter.</p>

<p>Core Lab out to take monthly samples.</p>

<p>Both recycle pumps swung into the production tank.</p>

<p>Called HVO to bring us 2 loads of 6-12 Baccalieu emulsion to see how the micro motion is reading.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 2 loads of 6-12, meter was accurate, will be bringing another load in tonight.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 34%.</p>

<p>Ordered C3 will be here thursday. 65% in the south tank 5% in the north tank.</p>
