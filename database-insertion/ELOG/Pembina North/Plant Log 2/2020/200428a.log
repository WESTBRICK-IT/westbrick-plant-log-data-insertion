========================================
<p>&nbsp;Took temps at start of shift</p>

<p>cleaned control room X2</p>

<p>found the res gas suction scrubber dump stuck open and dumping gas to the treater</p>

<p>Changed process H2S tape</p>

<p>07:00 started to bleed down WPNE flow line to V-200</p>

<p>Mancal sent pig, V-107 high leveled</p>

<p>approx 10:00 Bigoray shut in at 15ppm H2S, shut off WPNE flow, max we saw here was 5ppm</p>

<p>bleeding down WPNE flow line to flare for 2hrs 1600-380 kpa</p>

<p>blew down V-101 level control</p>

<p>GGT hauled in H2O</p>

<p>blocked in starters on all comp to trty to find source of fuel gas imbalance, suspect it may be the blanket gas to the treater</p>

<p>14:00 Vermilion pigging sour wells at west end of WPNE line and Perry sent pig towards 11-22</p>

<p>15:30 WPNE line tests at .5ppm, no pig in, found out the well pushing the pig would not flow so the line is not pigged out, shut off flare and called Kelley for direction on producing to V-200 or v-3101</p>

<p>K204 down on bad valve on cyl 4, Tyson checked and recomended to slow comp down as it may be starving the cyl</p>

<p>Kevin T calibrated H2S detection</p>

<p>Devin replaced the bottles on the GC and checked the calibration on the sales analyzer ( checked out good )</p>

<p>ribboned off washout by the water injection well</p>

<p>dumped LPG ditch #5</p>
