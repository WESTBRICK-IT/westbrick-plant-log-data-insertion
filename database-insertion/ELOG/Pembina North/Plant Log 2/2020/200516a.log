========================================
<p>Devin on site fixing south methanol pump.</p>

<p>Checked rates of each methanol pump multiple times. Both pumping fine.</p>

<p>Manually dumped amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Manually dumped inlet coalescer filter. Adjusted level controller slightly. Was not calling to dump. Will have to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump.</p>

<p>Drug the main road and yard in battery and around compression. Ground really soft by the barrel warehouse, so the drag has been spotted on the South side of the control room. Put a pylon on it.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom PM and AM.</p>

<p>Open doors in I/A building, warm ambient temps through day</p>

<p>Work on weekend checks</p>

<p>Snugged up packing on treater oil dump</p>

<p>Talk with Martin w/vermillion (780-723-1564)&nbsp; (5-14 line into V200). Was having trouble with his field ESD&#39;s.&nbsp; His well runs on timer, every 1.5 hrs it lifts for 15 min. His line esd&#39;s trip at 500kpa.&nbsp; <span style="color:#0000FF"><strong>*** NOTE:&nbsp;</strong></span> <span style="color:#0000FF">Adjusted V200 to hold BP on line 5-14 line at approx&nbsp; 615kpa <strong>***</strong></span></p>

<p>Called Kelly to update/confirm changes to process (no issues). Called Brandon to ensure no issues running V200 pump under increased pressure (no issues). Check vessel and PSV ratings (All good).</p>

<p>Add barrier blanket, increase to approx 700KPA to accomodate vessel pressure.</p>

<p>Pump out packing drain tanks TNK130, TNK 131</p>

<p>Check methanol pumps and levels.&nbsp; approx 200L/day</p>

<p>Recycled the boot for approx 8hrs</p>
