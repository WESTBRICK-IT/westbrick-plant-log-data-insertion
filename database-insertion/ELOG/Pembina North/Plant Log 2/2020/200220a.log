========================================
<p>Lowered the de eth bottoms temp from 75 to 74 degrees to raise the ethane spec abit.</p>

<p>Increaced the c3 surge tank pressure from 825 kpa to 880 kpa to help prevent c3 compressor from recycling.</p>

<p>Turned off the 2 speed condencer fan to raise the inlet temp to amine contactor. (from slow to off).</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 top and bottom&nbsp;louver temp control&nbsp;from 45 degrees to 41 degrees to maintain contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Instrument air building getting fairly warm. Opened the warm air vent to the outside so it doesnt blow so hard inside.</p>

<p>Raise chiller level from 34% to 40%. Nightshift is aware of changes, continuing to monitor process. Seems to be holding a bit colder. DP steady, no liquids showing in suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Lower refridge condenser fan pressure from 890 to 825kpa</p>

<p>Turn on low spd C3 fan. Ambient through day warm, helped keep inlet gas temp down and refridge discharge pressure down.</p>

<p>Add propane to accumulator. From 2 bolts to 7.</p>

<p>Caproco out to pull and change corrosion coupons. 4 plant inlets, 4 Amine, and 3 field sites. All went good, no issues. They called in to field site and called out when completed.</p>

<p>Taggert put to pick up K208 suction screen sample.&nbsp; Also took water samples off treater and water plant</p>

<p>Kevin T working on plant lighting. Annex is a bit dark, he is working on lighting and has one partially apart.</p>

<p>Tyson put together K202 fuel gas throttle body, closed out LOTO. Started up and Tyson balanced cyl. Run up RPM to 850, runs smooth. Shut down. *PSV still passing*</p>

<p>Flaring boot, adjust K208 boot recycle pressure controller a bit. Will monitor pressures and adjust if needed. Nightshift notified of change</p>

<p>Bad valves on K205 cyl 3 outboard suction and discharge.&nbsp; Kyle come down from Braz to help swap K204 into sales mode.&nbsp; Lock out K205 tyson changed valves.&nbsp; All back online, valving and comp back to normal</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivered RO water. Approx 5m3</p>

<p>Blue River hauling in produced water from Braz and Zeta.</p>

<p>K208 suction scrubber pump not pumping, dump to flare to get pumping, back onto boot</p>

<p>Tubing fitting on south chem pump leaking a bit into containment in inlet header building. Snugged up fitting, will monitor.</p>

<p>Pumped out TK130 comp lube oil underground tank. Was at 28 now donw to 10.</p>
