========================================
<p>&nbsp;Start of shift meeting on C3 not running.</p>

<p>Mark &amp; Daren checking over electrical components for the C3, testing breaker / panel. Could not find anything wrong.</p>

<p>Dew point analyzer time not reseting, sales valve closed, lost K205 x 2 requested Daren to lower the temp so we dont have to worry about it kicking us out of sales everytime &amp; lossing K205 over night</p>

<p>Called Fortis, rep come to site, informed us that they had switched the power feed from the Alta link station north of the plant to the Lodgepole station at 2 pm, causing us to loose power,&nbsp; so they tried&nbsp;increasing the power for us to try the C3, wasn&#39;t enough, they would not increase anymore due to safety concerns. They estimate the power will be switched back to the Atla Link station in the afternoon on Wed.</p>

<p>Informed&nbsp;Kelly on&nbsp;Fortis,&nbsp;discussed&nbsp;either to&nbsp;shut in or to cut flow, &nbsp;we shut in V3101&#39;s Wolf Creek, WPNE, 01-21. Mancal V103.. V104, Obsidian V200, V207. Allowing only EGGS (Bigoray gas) , V101 ( decreased flow to 130 decs) &amp; Vermillion 9-16 to continue to flow thru the plant. Note pad by the computer with all the contacts &amp; numbers that were called.</p>

<p>01:00-0300&nbsp;hrs All compression shut down, acid gas &amp; hot oil heater, no alarms other than units shut down, restarted them all, then 5 mins later all shut down again, after 3 times found the sales gas to the fuel gas scrubbers inlet control valve regulator which is supplied by the sales gas was freezing off due to the wet sales gas. Took the electric fan from the hot oil heater &amp; placed at the control valve regulator to push more warmer building air onto it. Started compression again. Left K201 down not needed until back to normal flows.</p>

<p>Sanitized contron start &amp; finish of shift</p>
