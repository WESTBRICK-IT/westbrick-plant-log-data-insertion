========================================
<p>Adjusted K-203 top and bottom louver temp control setpoint from 38 to 41 to maintain contactor inlet temp. Left the 2 speed condencer fan on fast.</p>

<p>Drained K-208 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Sales analyzer was spiking up randomly from 0 ppm to .8 ppm. Tape was not turning color and process analyzer was steady. Noticed the block for the eye was held halfway open beacuse the spring was stuck and wasnt touching the tape. Fixed and it seemed to help it to ready more steady.</p>

<p>Reviewed some procedures.</p>

<p>Skimmed charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>
