<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom&nbsp;AM and PM.</p>

<p>Sent off water samples to Element to get approval for dumping berms.</p>

<p>Eric, Kevin T and Polard out to scope out hot oil heater building temp issues. Filled out safety bypass form for fire eye bypass for use of camera.</p>

<p>Rob T hauling in Zeta water.</p>

<p>Kevin T programing remotes for automatic gates.</p>

<p>Baker Hughes delivered PAO-1001 and CRO-6990.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Took our tempatures this AM. Both 37 degrees. All good.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom&nbsp;AM and PM &amp; shift truck.</p>

<p>Sent off water samples to Element to get approval for dumping berms.</p>

<p>Eric, Kevin T and Polard out to scope out hot oil heater building temp issues. Filled out safety bypass form for fire eye bypass for use of camera.</p>

<p>Baker Hughes delivered PAO-1001 and CRO-6990.</p>

<p>Ryan Jordan out checking the packer isolation test for the acid gas well. He will be back again tomorrow AM.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan from &quot;off&quot; to&nbsp;&quot;fast&quot; to lower the contactor inlet temp and c3 accumulator temp.</p>

<p>Getting caught up validating Kyle on some of his CMDS profiles.</p>

<p>Amine tops temp at 101 and refluxing over 20m3 cut back reboiler tempature contol valve from 27% to 26%.</p>

<p>Reading through procedures.</p>

<p>Mark S and Kenny pigged the splitter line from Braz North to Pembina North.</p>

<p>Added barrier fluid to V-200 pump.</p>

<p>Water plant ESD due to tank hi level from trucked in fluid. ESD at 20 feet. Alarm cleared at 19.5 feet. Reset ESD all good.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Cut back amine water makeup rate from 20 to 15 as we have gained 14% level in the reboiler in 4 days. Concentration 4 days ago was 42%.</p>

<p>Lowered K-202 discharge tempature controller from 30 to 28 degrees to lower the contactor inlet temp.</p>
