========================================
<p>Shutdown K-206 for prelube pump replacment and service by Tyson and Apecs. Notified producers of the probability of increased line pressure.</p>

<p>Monitored instrument air compressor through the day and it ran steady.</p>

<p>Closed doors on the instrument air building to warm it up.</p>

<p>Increased debute fan speed to lower the de bute pressure. From 30 to 90% output.</p>

<p>Shutdown the de bute overhead fan and de bute bottoms cooler fan for PM&#39;s and so Kevin T could do some electrical work.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed condencer fan on fast.</p>

<p>Took water samples of the ditched and will drop them off tonight at Exxova.</p>

<p>Gas outlet of chiller tube side piping and isolation valve looked to be damaged as the old insulation was dinted and piping looked bent. Took all the insulation off and chipped away the ice and upon further investigation it looks like the ice buildup from freeze and thaw had pushed up on the piping and mis shaped the insulation. Piping seems to be in good condition. Almost all the ice is chipped away underneath, will let the sun melt the rest and chip away as needed. May have to dig the ground away for more clearance in the future.</p>

<p>Dumped berms.</p>

<p>Booked Allan B to come out tomorrow and do some welding on the LPG berm culvert gate to get it back in working order.</p>

<p>DV Rentals has been called and will come out tomorrow first thing in the AM to pick up the trash pump.</p>

<p>Reflux meter was bouncing off zero. Increaced the amine reboiler tempature control valve from 25 to 26. Regen tops temp warmed up abit and reflux came back up to around 12 m3.</p>

<p>Covid 19 testing shed has been delivered. Will get it set up tomorrow with supplies for use. Kevin T will be sourcing out power for it.</p>

<p>Colin with Mancal pigged a lateral line into the 6&quot;. Planning to pig the 6&quot; into the plant tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bob Koethler and Mike A waling around the facilities doing inspections.</p>

<p>Ryan Jordan on site at the acid gas well with KPA to pump diesel down the casing and add pressure. Seems to have settled down around 8050 KPA. Will have to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Rob T hauling Zeta water.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Pulled 1-21 pig.</p>

<p>Propane should be delivered tomorrow as Ryan Blair ordered some for Braz a couple days ago.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Refridge compressor will probably be going on Thursday to replace the valve cap seals on res gas and c3 cylinders. Caps have been flagged for reference.</p>
