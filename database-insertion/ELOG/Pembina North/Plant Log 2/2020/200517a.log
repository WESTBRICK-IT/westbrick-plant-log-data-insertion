========================================
<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom PM and AM.</p>

<p>Checked both methanol pump rates.</p>

<p>Manually dumped inlet coalescer filter. Level controller seems to be controlling fine now.</p>

<p>Reviewing procedures.</p>

<p>V-200 flows leveled out and controlled after the first couple cycles from Vermilion well after dayshift made changes to BP controller. All good. K-202 handling fine.</p>

<p>LP header flare relief cycled a couple times when Vermilion well to V-200 first kicked and V-104 Torc well kicked. V-200 was flowing 31 e3m3 and V-104 was flowing 19 e3m3 at the time. Header pressure came back down and maintained shortly after.</p>
