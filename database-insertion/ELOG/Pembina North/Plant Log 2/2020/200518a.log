<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom PM and AM.</p>

<p>Blew down inlet coalescer filter.</p>

<p>Drained amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 scrubber pump.</p>

<p>Checked methanol pumps. South pump was vapour locked and not pumping. Opened bleed for abit then the pump took off and started pumping. Good through the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Drug the front parking area and water plant.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Cut back V-200 inlet pressure control from 625 KPA to 620 KPA to lower pressure on the LP header abit when Vermilion well kicks.</p>

<p>Check methanol pumps. South pump was not stroking. Grease plunger BOL.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check bulk tank and fill both bulk and storage tidy tank</p>

<p><span style="color:#0000FF">**Field OPS Kenny, notified us 5-21 showed a little DP today, has come back to normal range. Suspect our methanol pumps may have contributed. We increased rate from 200L/day to 220L/day. <strong>**OPS will increase pump checks on dayshift and nightshift ***</strong></span></p>

<p>Ditch samples are valid, test PH and chlorides, release all 5 berms.&nbsp; All berms are currently closed.</p>

<p>Add nitrogen to V200 barrier fluid. Approx 700kpa</p>

<p>Cleaned up staining around process. Mostly from hot oil valves.</p>

<p>Snugged packing on valves listed below on WO</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000"><strong><u>WO-36441-</u></strong></span> Packing leaks on 4 valves-&nbsp; Hot oil relief, De-eth boiler bypass, De-bute boiler bypass, Amine boiler control valve.</p>

<p>Scope out A/G meter job tomorrow, talk with Mark S.</p>
