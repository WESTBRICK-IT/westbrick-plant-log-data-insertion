========================================
<p>Sanitized control room</p>

<p>Started weekend checks</p>

<p>Skimmed Amine reboiler several times, has a pad of oil on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got reflux pump to stabilize for most of the day.&nbsp; Night shift may need to skim as well.</p>

<p>Lowered level in the Amine contactor 10% to get level to skim.</p>

<p>Lowered Reflux accumulator level.</p>

<p>Added about half a liter of anti foam to the amine system.</p>

<p>Amine condenser temp is running hot.&nbsp; May need the cooler cleaned.</p>

<p>Blew down the reflux flow meter.</p>

<p>Added glycol to the wet leg on K-202 dump.</p>

<p>Topped up methanol skid and tank, pumps ran fine all day.</p>
