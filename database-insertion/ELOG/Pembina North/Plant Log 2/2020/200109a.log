========================================
<p>Refridge compressor down at the start of shift. Tyson looking into the propane loss issues. Found the bottom packing vent line inside of cyl#1 distance peice venting hard. Put lapping compound on the packing and fired back up.</p>

<p>Added propane to the accumulator from .5 to 4 bolts. Monitored through the night and the level maintained between 4 and 5 bolts. Hopefully it continues to hold. Storage tank 48% to 38%. Should be some delivered today.</p>

<p>Put the 2 speed c3 condencer fan from fast to slow as the res gas and c3 louvers were both 0% closed.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-202 compressor to warm up the contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>3006 process LEL head reading faulty. Reset the head and it went back to normal.</p>
