========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Rob Thirsk hauled in Zeta water and sucked out secondary containments.</p>

<p>-Apex worked on BC3 compressor.</p>

<p>-Csm compression out to pick up compressor parts.</p>

<p>-Tyson took oil samples, also turned in the power screw on K-202 1-1/2 turns because it was overfueling due to hardly any load on the compressor causing a surge in RPM, also changed the lead on cylinder 4.</p>

<p>-Baker out to check chemical levels.</p>

<p>-Took part in the WPNE offload through V-200 MOC. Started on a procedure for going sour and sweetening up. Wpne inlet will close at 5ppm and alarm at 3ppm. The only esd that will shut is ESDY 3000.</p>

<p>-Opened up the hot oil valve to the amine reboiler to 10% manual, just incase wpne had more sour.</p>

<p>-Mark Spelrem out chasing down the sour gas coming in on the splitter line, he found Mancal 1-15 40ppm sour. The well is shut in for the time being.</p>

<p>-Swung wpne production into V-200 and very slowly bringing it in. We took a sample and were at 3 ppm before we started at around 3:30PM</p>

<p>-Found the methanol pumps in the annex building vapor locked. Got them pumping and monitored them several times throughout the day.</p>

<p>-Swung recycle b pump out of the overflow tank into the production tank.</p>
