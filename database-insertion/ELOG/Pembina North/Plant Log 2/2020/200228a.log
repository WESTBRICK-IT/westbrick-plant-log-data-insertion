========================================
<p>&nbsp;Dallas changed water plant filters, switched pots.&nbsp; Found a pin hole on the 1&quot; drain line to the tank on the pump discharge.&nbsp; MITS submitted #16634</p>

<p>Shut down for K-202 pop valve replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back up K-206 wouldn&#39;t grab compressor oil pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris Nagy did a fix and got it going.</p>

<p>Big thank you to Dayton, Ryan Blaire, and Bryan for their help on the shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t have gone as smooth without them!</p>

<p>RO water delivered by Nelson Bros.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in 2 loads of Braz water.</p>

<p>Added some glycol from overhead, 30% to accumulator.</p>

<p>K-206 RPM are in manual mode.&nbsp; set at 895 rpm.</p>
