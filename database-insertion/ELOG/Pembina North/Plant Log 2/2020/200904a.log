========================================
<p>Sanitized control room.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcaol filter.</p>

<p>Called Brandon out due to P-4750 amine charge pump vibration alarm. Pump seemed to be running smooth. Added pressure to the discharge bladder. Restarted. Still ringing in on vibration. Vibration transmitter&nbsp;was poorly mounted. Brandon moved the transmitter down the line abit and mounted better. no alarms since.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Braz water.</p>

<p>Diagnosing some acid gas flare issues. Found 1st stage scrubber manual dump valve passing. Closed up and it helped.</p>

<p>Working on some acid gas flare metering issues with Kristina. Vacuum pump fuel gas purge is reading a flow rate to the flare. Will have to manually calculate fuel gas purge on books.</p>

<p>Opened up doors, louvers, vent fan and roof vents on acid gas compressor due to ambiant temps. Nightshift, can you please close up doors tonight.</p>

<p>Snuged up packing on EG injection pump. Seems to be holding fine.</p>
