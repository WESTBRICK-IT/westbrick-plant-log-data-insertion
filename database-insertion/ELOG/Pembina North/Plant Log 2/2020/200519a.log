========================================
<p>Raised V-200 back pressure controller from 605 KPA to 610 KPA to help prevent LP heading flaring when V-200 wells kick.</p>

<p>Checked the methanol pump rates multiple times. All good.</p>

<p>Inlet coalescer level in the top of the sight glass. Was not calling to dump, Adjusted controller abit and the dump valve opened but then would not close. Assuming the level column is full of sludge again, blew down but no change. <span style="color:#FF0000">WO#36442.</span></p>

<p>Monitored K-204/203 discharge pressures. K-203 maintained anywhere from 4500-4700 KPA and K-203 maintained 4100-4300 KPA Pending on gas flow.6-23 pressure around 3800-4100 KPA. 8-24 pressure around 3500-3700 KPA. 5-21 pressure 3300-3400 kpa. DP between 8-24 and 5-21 hung around 250-280 KPA. Didnt notice much change in discharge and pipline pressures over an 8 day trend, Maybe 100-200 kpa increase over 8 days. Pipline could maybe use a pig and a 500L methanol batch. Will continue to keep monitoring.</p>

<p>Raised K-203 top and bottom cooler discharge temp 2 degrees.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room and bathroom PM and AM.</p>

========================================
<p>Chris N and Apecs on site. Apecs working on C3B clean up and parts logging</p>

<p>Kevin T out working in office, doing some electric equipment clean up</p>

<p>Kristina and Mark S on site in AM to pull A/G well meter (Will be back tomorrow for install).&nbsp; KPA and GGT out to flush meter with Methanol and catch any excess fluid<span style="color:#4B0082">. </span><strong><span style="color:#800080">** Well and pipeline locked out,<u> PN OPS Lock # 3</u> **</span></strong></p>

<p>Core Labs out to take propane samples off accumulator. Took liquid sample and vapour sample as per Kristina (for C3B investigation info)</p>

<p>Info gathering for Brandon scoping out suction line off chiller to C3, and discharge line off compressor. Gave line length estimates.</p>

<p>Erik looking for valve info and C3 bypass info</p>

<p>Sample Berms #1, 2, 4, 5 and the hydrovac lined containment. <span style="color:#0000FF"><strong>** OPS please note hydro vac containment berm is a different sample and needs to be labelled as such, with notice to Bob K. Sample test is slightly different **</strong></span></p>

<p>Rob hauling zeta creek water most of the day. 4 loads hauled.</p>

<p>Check methanol pumps through day.&nbsp; Found south vapour locked once, bled off BOL. Rate has remained steady at 220L/day</p>

<p>Place small order with Carl, MRC. Testing strips, rubber containers, misc warehouse stock.</p>

<p>Inlet coalescer dump stuck open while in cycle, backed off dump a bit and it closed. Function test, seems to be clear. Will closely monitor for normal operation</p>

<p>Clean and sanatize work areas</p>
