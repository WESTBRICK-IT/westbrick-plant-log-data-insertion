========================================
<p>Sanitize control room</p>

<p>Kebray out to replace glycol pump dicharge piping.&nbsp;&nbsp; Took a bit to drain the accumulator, had to pump it to the front end. Job went well otherwise.</p>

<p>Added glycol after start up.</p>

<p>Shut down C3 compressor, Chris and Tyson repaired leaks on res gas side and checked valves on Cyl 1 discharge.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color:#FF0000">Could night shift please chck the jack screw on 1st stage discharge to ensure they aren&#39;t backing off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lines are marked.</span></p>

<p>Lost K-201and K-206 because the gas to gas froze off, pumped some methanol and it freed up.</p>

<p>Turned on bulk cooler to help the C3 compressor draw down suction pressure.</p>

<p>Treater H2S head rang in negative drift, Mark calibrated and is back to normal.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers on K-201 and K-203 comps</p>
