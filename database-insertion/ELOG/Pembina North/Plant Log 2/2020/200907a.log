========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Furnace in control room not working. Inducer&nbsp;fan for heat exchanger&nbsp;wouldnt kick on. Possibly a tripped pressure or limit switch? Manually turned wheel counter clockwise and it reset. May need to get it looked over.</p>

<p>Finished weekend checks.</p>

<p>Hauled away methanol pump for Bigoray offload and stored up on hill.</p>

<p>Emptied garbages and used rag bins throughout the plant.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 38%. Slowed down makeup pump from 25 to 20. Should maintain or slowly lower concentration at 20.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>AIT-3101 h2s head and 3006 LEL head started to ring in and out constatly. Both faulty. Nathan came out to fix.</p>

<p>Acid gas 5150 cooler rang in on vibration a few times. Trending normal but has random spikes. Could be a faulty transmitter? Motor bearing sounded like it could be growling abit. Got Nathan to look at it while he was here. He greased it, we will have to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Pembina is keeping our tank levels high because they have a tool run in the near future so they are trying to keep producers tank levels high for it. If we ring in hi level we can give them a call and they will pump us down as needed. 780-400-4671.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Zeta water.</p>
