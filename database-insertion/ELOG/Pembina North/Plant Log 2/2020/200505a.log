<p>-Devin calibrated the recycle valve to K-206, it seaming to be controling alot better.</p>

<p>-Changed the plant pressure set point on PIC -7003 to 2700 kpa and its back controling in Auto and Pic 7002 is back in manual with a control setpoint of 15%, its controled plant pressure just fine all day.</p>

<p>-Devin took 2 baker pumps to town to get repaired</p>

<p>-Exova water sample reports came back and berms are good to dump. Sampled and dumped berm water.</p>

<p>-Tyson tightened the amine booser pump seal and installed a piece of tubing to allow it to drip into a pail instead of on the floor if the seal was to start leaking again.</p>
