<p>Topped up LPG packing lubricator.</p>

<p>Hi-Flo (Jason) out to prove the keylink meter.</p>

<p>CEL (Lyndon) out to inspect the filter pots in the water plant, he wasn&#39;t too concerned with them, said the east pot could be put back to service.</p>

<p>Reinstalled filter canisters and filters in the East pot, replaced the O-Ring for the canister lid, purged out and blocked in, West pot still in service.</p>

<p>Tyson and Clayton with Apecs out to do the PM on the H2O disposal pump and replace valves on the suction and discharge of the pump, pump now flows around 370m3/day, no does not seem to hammer anymore, however the tubing pressure on the well hit 6380KPA before pump shut down on low tank level, will have to monitor tubing pressures once Rob starts hauling in water, also will need to ensure the discharge pulsation bladder is set accordingly.</p>

<p>Both water plant booster pumps are in auto and so is the disposal pump.</p>

<p>Cleaned up around the water plant.</p>

<p>Devin N. replaced a faulty cooler vibration sensor on K-205 W.O.#37373</p>

<p>Sanitized control room.</p>

<p>Supports for Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; were loose and pump was starting to shake, reinstalled supports and tightened them up.</p>

<p>Tyson took compressor oil samples.</p>

<p>Pumped up wet leg on K-202 4th stage scrubber.</p>
