========================================
<p>8-24 and 14-3 comms alarms ringing in. Seemed to clear themselves and nobody called me, so</p>

<p>Top up LPG lubricator oil</p>

<p>Glycol water recover tank level alarm, dump some to clear alarm. Will clear with dayshift where it normally goes.</p>

<p>Plant steady through night. No adjustments made</p>

========================================
<p>-Pumped out the glycol recovery tank to the water flash tank.</p>

<p>-Amine concentration is still at 43.7%, increased the water make-up from 15 to 18.</p>

<p>-Lean Glycol is at 81% concentration.</p>

<p>-Increased the amine regen tops temp control valve from 27 to 27.5.</p>

<p>-Don with Polard Insulation out today to scope out our list, will be insulating</p>

<p>-Jordy spread some gravel at the end of the road with the skidsteer.</p>

<p>-Added barrier fluid to V-200.</p>

<p>-Raised the southwest and northwest trim cooler tarps a little.</p>

<p>-Tyson found a leaking lube oil tubing line on K-3301B, sent in a workorder for it to be fixed during compressor outage next week. WO# 35463.</p>

<p>-Brad with Cathodic solutions out working in the field.</p>

<p>-Melted snow and a bunch of water running down the ditch on the south side of plant lease road.&nbsp; Assumed spring water but tested pH just in case.&nbsp; pH of 7, just looks like a spring.</p>
