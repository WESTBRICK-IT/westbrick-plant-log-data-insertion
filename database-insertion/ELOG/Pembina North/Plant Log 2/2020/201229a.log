<p>do truck inspection</p>

<p>&nbsp;called PPL at 00:50 to start pump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pembina pumped 14m3 before shutting in on density, pumps will remain down until 07:00 at least.&nbsp; Day shift to call for start</p>

<p>GC rang in alarm at 05:00.&nbsp; Low H2.&nbsp; still some H2 to burn off before bottle exchange</p>

========================================
<p>- Bypassed TR-101 Exchanger to try and heat up production going to Boot and flash off as much light ends as possible to help with density.</p>

<p>- Started the Production tank agitator and ran it for about an hour.</p>

<p>- Decreased the LP to Boot makeup on K-202 due to the increase in flash gas from the boot to 1st Stage suction.</p>

<p>- Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, clean.</p>

<p>- Rob (GGT) out hauled Braz and Zeta produced water.</p>

<p>- Called Pembina Pipeline at 12:40PM, started pumping and have been running around 777-778 density, still pumping at shift change, currently 100m<sup>3</sup> pumped.</p>

<p>- Built new PM binder for 2021 and updated daily computer entries for 2021 as well.</p>

<p>- Called Nelson Bros for a load of makeup water, notified Braz River, will be out tomorrow.</p>

<p>- Trent (HVO) brought in a 30m<sup>3</sup> load of Mancal emulsion from 13-28-48-13W5, had an average density of 840.</p>

<p>- Jordan (Baker Hughes) out to check on chemical rates.</p>

<p>- Packing on the amine charge pump (East Plunger) was dripping steadily, snugged it up a little.</p>

<p>- Sanitized control room at the start and end of shift.</p>

<p>- Changed the hydrogen bottle out on the GC.</p>

<p>- Monitored fuel gas piping to carburetor on K-206 as per Brandon G. about it shaking, compressor was running around 860-880RPM throughout the day and was not shaking, nightshift if you wouldn&#39;t mind checking on it tonight, thanks!</p>

<p>- Pulled Obsidian PNA and 1-21 pigs for Kim, he would like to pig them tomorrow.</p>
