========================================
<p>Vermilion pigged to V-101/V-103 this AM.</p>

<p>V-101 level transmitter was reading incorrectly, blew down sensing lines.</p>

<p>North LPG pump lubricator for the East plunger wasnt lubricating very well. Pulled and cleaned out the lubricator line.</p>

<p>Water plant filters plugged off right as the pumps were about to kick off on low level at the end of the day. Pumped out canister and letting the filters drain overnight. Will change out in the AM. Clean filter canister is swung into service.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Looking over exhaust fan for Hot Oil heater with Kevin and Kelly.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed c3 condencer/res gas fan from &quot;slow&quot; to &quot;fast&quot; to lower the contactor inlet temp. Will have to put back on slow tonight.</p>

<p>Opened up the louvers and tarps abit on the Acid gas condencer (north side) and just the tarp on the West side to maintain the 28 degree setpoint. Will have to pinch louvers and tarps a little tonight.</p>

<p>Opened up the window and cracked the door slightly on the sullair compressor building. It was around 35 degrees this afternoon.</p>

<p>Opened the overhead door in process building to cool it down abit. May need to close up tonight.</p>
