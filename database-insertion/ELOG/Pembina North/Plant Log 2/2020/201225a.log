========================================
<p>sanitize control room start and end of shift</p>

<p>reboiler hot oil controller (TIC 4300) 38 to 37 to prevent some water boil off</p>

<p>stopped production/ overflow equalize at 18:30.&nbsp; Recycling only from production tank</p>

<p>Called PPL to start up pump at 02:40 to test density.&nbsp; Tank level wasn&#39;t high enough so have to wait to build level</p>

<p>reboiler hot oil controller (TIC 4300) from 37 back to 38 at tops temp was a little low.</p>

========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>Amine concentration at 35%.</p>

<p>Added amine from over head tank for about 40 seconds to bring up concentration, then turned the amine makeup pump from 18 to 20 to raise the amine reboiler level.</p>

<p>Started weekend checks.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG lubricator.</p>

<p>Manually dump de eth suction scrubber. and K-202 2nd stage suction scrubber.</p>

<p>14-03 was supposed to be pigged today. Asked Mark to put it off until next week due to the density issues.</p>

<p>Called Pembina to get them to turn on the pumps. Density between 777 and 778. They ran the pumps until they shut down on low tank level (2.8 meters) and pumped 53 m3.</p>

<p>Left both pumps recycle pumps in the shipping tank for the day. After Pembina kicks on for the second time we can swing recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow and slowly recycle out of the overflow and see where that brings us.</p>
