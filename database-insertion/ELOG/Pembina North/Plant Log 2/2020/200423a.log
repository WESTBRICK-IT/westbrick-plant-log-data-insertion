========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Plant upset at the start of shift due to c3 compressor failure.</p>

<p>-All gas going to Bigoray, we had a sour pocket that we had to draw back through K205 compressor to flare.</p>

<p>-V-104 is in mp mode from lp &nbsp;and the inlet control setpoint is set to 800 from 300kpa</p>

<p>-Tried to&nbsp;bring in 14-3 pipline gas but the ppm&#39;s started to climb, shut in to keep sweet and running.</p>

<p>-Sanitized and cleaned&nbsp;the control room.</p>

<p>-Took body temps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;took temps at start of shift</p>

<p>cleaned the control room X2</p>

<p>Superior delivered&nbsp;a load of C3</p>

<p>Keabray out to install blinds on C3B</p>

<p>opened up wolf creek inlet</p>

<p>had a couple spikes on the sales analyzer, unable to determine where it is comming from, we do not want to exceed 4ppm on the sales</p>

<p>Tyson, Chris and Brandon working on the C3</p>

<p>cut back the Zeta blend gas to 160</p>

<p>GGT hauled in H2O</p>

<p>closed the recycle to k206 from the back of process</p>

<p>changed the H2O plant filters</p>

<p>switched amine recycle pumps, WO 36215 in to check the motor on P-4510</p>

<p>Daren lowered the alarm on the sales analyzer to 4ppm, it is just an alarm and will not shut down anything</p>

<p>started k202 with just the boot and LP valves open and discharging to process to try and reduce the flareing, will sweep process out to flare from pic-7000b to make sure it is sweet the open up the recycle valve to k206 to ship to Bigoray.</p>

<p>swung v-104 back to LP header</p>

<p>amine reboiler temp control at 0% on manual</p>

<p>wolf creek inlet on manual at 20% open to slowly bring down the pressure.</p>
