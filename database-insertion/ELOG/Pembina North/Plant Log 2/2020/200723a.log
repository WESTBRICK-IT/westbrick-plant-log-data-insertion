========================================
<p>&nbsp;Sanititized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Bypassed fire eyes breifly for lightning storm passing. Restored shortly after.</p>

<p>PPM&#39;s to Bigoray climbing a bit higher than normal. 2.9 ppm&#39;s. Tested inlets. All sweet except 5-14 (2.5 ppm&#39;s) and 14-03 (4 ppm&#39;s).</p>

<p>Checked and lubed methanol pumps numerous times through the night. All good.</p>

<p>Will have to get rob to suck out process floor drains as it is flooded out due to lastnights storm. Secondaries are getting full too.</p>

<p>Manually dumped inlet coalescer filter.</p>

========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Rob Thirsk hauled in Zeta water and sucked out the process floor drains.</p>

<p>-Kelly&#39;s trucking delivered C3B discharge bottle, Both Chris and Tyson set it in place and Al Barney tacked the throat to the bottle once in place. Kelly&#39;s then delivered the bottle back to Enerflux for welding.</p>

<p>-Pumped out the amine pump packing drip tank.</p>

<p>-Filled the bigoray offload methanol pumps, rates at 270 l/d</p>

<p>-Checked inlets for sour, noticed the analyzer ppm&#39;s at 2.2. We didn&#39;t find enough sour to make the analyzer to read high. Work ordered the analyzer (37089)</p>

<p>-Sucked out sumps in the compressor building.</p>

<p>-Validated Kyle on some of his CMDS</p>
