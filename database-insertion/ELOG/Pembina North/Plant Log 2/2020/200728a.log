========================================
<p>&nbsp;Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Sped up compression once ambiant temps cooled down.</p>

<p>Blew down inlet coalescer filter.</p>

<p>Blew down treater front and back water sight glasses.</p>

<p>South methanol pump down. Had to adjust the arm to toggle the micro switch as it wasnt quite pushing switch far enough.&nbsp;Moved the arm 1/8th of an inch and it pumped the rest of the night.</p>

<p>5-21 ESD rang in travel. Notified Perry, he said they will do some work on it first thing in the AM. Monitored DP across ESD through the night. All good.</p>

<p>Sales PPM&#39;s slowly climbing at Braz. Got up to 3.3 PPM before we left. Romeo sampled inlets there. All good except V-101 (8a-35) which sampled over 8 ppm. Seems to be the culprit. Shouldnt be an issue but dayshift please keep an eye on it until Braz North op arrives.</p>

<p>-Regen tops temp was cooling off so i opened up the reboiler temp control valve</p>

<p>-5-21 rang in saying it had closed, but on the screen just showed it was in travel, called perry and he has instrumentation looking into it first thing this morning.</p>

<p>-Bypassed fire eyes for good part of the night while it was storming.</p>
