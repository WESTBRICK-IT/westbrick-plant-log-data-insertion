========================================
<p>Sanitize control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>1-21 line to v-200 line froze off, put 1m3 of methanol down the line and left equalized for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-21 production is swung into v-3101.</p>

<p>lowered trim cooler tarps on the south side.&nbsp; May need to adjust more.</p>

<p>shut off bulk cooler fan and set louvers from 28 degrees to 33 degrees.&nbsp; may need to adjust</p>

<p>Methanolled inlet to gas to gas exg=changer due to pressure up a bit on the inlet.&nbsp; Seemed to have helped dropped p[ressure 400kpa.</p>

<p>V-200 pump is having issues pumping.&nbsp; Increased back pressure to 280 kpa from 240kpa to help grab suction.</p>

<p>Duvera working on plant drawings.</p>

<p>Braz LP. H2S analyser blew a fuse and is not working.&nbsp; Need to monitor sales line ppm.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it gets over 4ppm shut in LP seps and take gas samples to find the issue.</p>

<p>Chris was out hanging meter tags.</p>

<p>Smoke detection in old MCC was installed.</p>
