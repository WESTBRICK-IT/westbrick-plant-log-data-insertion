<p>V-101 and V-103 down on high liquid level, V-103 high level would not reset, blocked in and depressured V-103 for Devin to remove and repair the switch</p>

<p>Vermilion shut in thier flow for a few hours to do some pigging on thier end</p>

<p>GGT hauled H2O from Zeta and bled down pressure from V-103</p>

<p>shut off splitter line as the service on K103 was canceled</p>

<p>Baker delivered 2 pails of inhibitor for the methanol</p>

<p>topped up the methanol tank</p>

<p>worked on the master action list, cleaned up staining at 14-22</p>

<p>took H2O samples for Element</p>

<p>Daren, Devin and Kevin T working on process instrumentation</p>
