========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Changed out water plant filters.</p>

<p>-tyson, brandon and apecs finishing up work on C3 B.</p>

<p>-went to purge C3 B compressor and found cross piping from discharge bottle to suction bottle leaking, tightened up but theres bit of a gap on the north end flange, mechanics will finish up tomorrow first thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied LOTO.</p>

<p>-Loosened off res gas cross piping to 2nd stage and adjusted spacer and replaced gaskets.</p>

<p>-Sped compressors up once it cooled off outside.</p>

<p>-Checked methanol pumps through out the night.</p>

<p>-Sanitized control room.</p>

<p>-Water plant rang in shut down but on the screen everything looked good, walked down there and had to reset the water plant in the MCC, everything fired back up.</p>

<p>-HVO hauled in a load of oil from MANCAL.</p>

<p>--Bypassed fire eyes for a good part of the night due to the storms rolling through.</p>

========================================
<p>-K-3301B C3 compressor start up today.&nbsp; Brandon G, Chris N, Tyson T, and APECS on site to do mechanical work.&nbsp; Devin N on site for instrumentation Mark S on site for electrical, and Daren F on site for programming.</p>

<p>-Mark Spelrem and Chris P on site to flip spec blind to stop offloading.&nbsp; All gathering compressors knocked down for this.&nbsp; Compressors back online, with the addition of K-205 sales compressor&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Tried to start K-3301B but vibration issues on start up, faulty vibration sensor and set up a 5 second delay on vibration for start up.&nbsp; Issues fixed</p>

<p>-After starting compressor, it had to be shut down due to leaking gasket on suction bottle.&nbsp; Compressor shut down and LOTO again to remove bottle and replace gasket</p>

<p>-Compressor fired up again, no issues. Loading compressor is pretty slow now</p>

<p>-Added glycol to the accumulator</p>

<p>-Added C3 to the accumulator</p>

<p>-K-203 4th cylinder inboard suction valve high temp.&nbsp; Fired up K-201 to take this gas, shut down K-203 and LOTO for mechanics to change valves.&nbsp; Compressor back online and K-201 shut down and depressured again</p>

<p>-HVO hauled in 1 load of oil from Mancal 13-18-49-12w5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
