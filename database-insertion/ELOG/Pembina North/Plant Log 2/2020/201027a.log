========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Shut down K-203 compressor for water pump and tubing line replacment. Fired back up all good.</p>

<p>Shut down K-205 for service and water pump replacement. Fired back up all good.</p>

<p>Shut down K-204 and put it to sales mode for the services. Back online taking V-101 production.</p>

<p>K-206 started to detonate and the valve train became fairly noisey with the extra load. Went away after starting K-203 back up. Any issues with it tonight call Tyson.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 2 loads of Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; vapour locked when truck offloaded. Purged and back online.</p>

<p>Wolf Creek will be batching tomorrow.</p>

<p>Scoping out 16-04 Obsidian pipeline lay up.</p>

<p>Boot gas flow boss powered down and restarted as it was flatlined.</p>

<p>Spread gravel on ice with skid steer.</p>

<p>Recycle pump &quot;B&quot; swung into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de etrh suction scrubber. Keep an eye on level tonight. May need to manually dump.</p>

<p>Sped up the de bute fan speed from 45 to 70%. You may have to adjust as needed to maintain around 850 to 950 KPA.</p>

<p>C3 compressor suction valve is pinched back in auto due to extra load from all the line pack. Keep an eye on it. It should open back up to 100% once the line pack comes down.</p>

<p>Raised the chiller level from 9.5% to 10.5% to lower the tempature differential abit.</p>

<p>Replaced PSV on the GC and its back in service.</p>

========================================
<p>Plant steady.</p>

<p>Manually pumped flare knockout. Pumping into the boot. Pembina started alarming on high BS&amp;W. Recycled boot and production for an hour. Put back into overflow once it stop shipping and BS&amp;W drops.</p>

<p>Skimmed charcoal filter, clean.</p>

<p>Dumped chiller de-oiler, empty.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>Set chiller level from 10.5 to 9.7%, maintained temperature differential around 4 deg C.</p>

<p>Set debute fan TIC-3111 from 70 to 55%.</p>

<p>Amine contactor kept ringing in on high differential. Heat trace is working. Wrapped it around with some more insulation and temporary install a PSV insulation to keep heat around it.</p>

<p>Set K201 louver control from 32 to 35 to keep inlet temperature around 30 deg C. It stayed around 29.</p>

<p>Disinfected control room twice.</p>
