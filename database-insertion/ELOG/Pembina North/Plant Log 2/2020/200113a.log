========================================
<p>Shut off the c3 pump to the accumulator.</p>

<p>C3 accumulator maintained 4 bolts of level all night.</p>

<p>Blocked in the recycle pump to the boot.</p>

<p>Recycle temp in the trim cooler was starting to cool off quite abit. Overhead condencer louvers were open 100%. Concencer temp running around 33 degrees after the tarps were closed. Increased the setpoint from 25 to 35 to get the overhead louvers to pinch and keep more heat in the cooler. Recycle temp around 14 degrees now.</p>

<p>Couldnt get the spare truck to start tonight. Charged the battery and got it running. Let it run for awhile.</p>

<p>Added nitrogen to V-200 pump baldder.</p>

<p>Zeta Creek gates would not close. Jordy spent the night up there.</p>

<p>Left the taps in the maintenance office cracked open abit to prevent the water line from freezing.</p>

<p>Closed some windows in the battery to keep some building heat in.</p>

<p>Gas flows were up and down. Got as low as 380 e3m3.</p>

<p>Process water at 20%. Using about 10% every 24hrs at current rate. Dayshift will have to order water to arrive for Monday or Tuesday please.</p>

<p>Zeta Creek security camera and 11-22 battery offload security camera lost signal at Pem North. WO#35179.</p>

========================================
<p>Glycol level on C3B compressor slowly dropping.&nbsp; Found small leak on Cyl 3 fitting.&nbsp; Tightened up and seems better.&nbsp; Added glycol from 20% to 80%.&nbsp; Marked level on sightglass with marker.</p>

<p>Closed manual louvers behind K-203 and K-204 cooler banks.&nbsp; Found that it actually caused them to cool off more due to the fact they were not getting any of the recycle air.&nbsp; Opened back up all the way.</p>

<p>Secured tarp on K-204 cooler bank with tie-downs, bottom half completely tarped off.&nbsp; Should help with discharge cooler temps.</p>

<p>Chris Paige out delivering bulk oil.</p>

<p>Asked Daren to make available to us in the control room the vibrations trends for C3 compressors and amine charge pumps.</p>

<p>Ryan Blair worked on updating our compressor log sheets.</p>

<p>Rob Thirsk (GGT) hauled in Zeta water and Braz water.</p>

<p>Ordered Process water, will be here first thing tomorrow.</p>
