<p>Manually dumped K-203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Called D.V. Rentals and ordered out a 6&quot; trash pump to pump out holding pond #5 at the LPG bullet due to culvert manway being frozen.</p>

<p>Devin N. out to change K-203, 205, 206, 202 compressor recycle louvers back to summer mode due to ambient temps.</p>

<p>Devin N. worked on process H2S analyzer.</p>

<p>Pulled PNA pig from trap, few handfulls of wax in the reciever, swung back out of the reciever.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivere amine makeup water.</p>

<p>Main Sullair compressor down twice, down on &quot;High Spiral Valve Pressure&quot;, went down at exactly 880KPA on instrument air header, around 128-129 psi on compressor @ 187 degrees F. Called Brandon out to have a look.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers and tarps on the amine trim cooler.</p>

<p>Turned the c3 condencer fan to fast.</p>

<p>Core labs out to take monthly samples.</p>

<p>Amine concentration is at 39.5%. Glycol is 83% lean and 77% rich.</p>

<p><span style="color:#FF0000">Nightshift, can you keep an eye on the trash pump over night, <span style="background-color:#00FF00">DIESEL</span> fuel level was full at the end of shift. Fuel system will air lock if ran dry. </span></p>

<p>Increased de bute overhead fan speed to lower debute pressure. from 20 to 35%.</p>

<p>-Sanatized the control room at the start and end of the shift.</p>

<p>-Took body temps, both good.</p>

<p>-Filled the lpg lubricator.</p>

<p>-The holding pond down by the lpg was empty at shift change, day shift got the gate to open up some and it was enough to drain all the water. Rented pump shut off.</p>

<p>-Brandon worked on the Sulair, he lowered the unload pressure to 115 psi to help from over pressuring the spiral valve.</p>

<p>-Set the volcano heater plate that Kelly Dropped off in the shop on a pallet to keep it out of the weather.</p>

<p>-Reviewed procedures.</p>

<p>-Switched the 2 speed c3 fan from fast to slow.</p>
