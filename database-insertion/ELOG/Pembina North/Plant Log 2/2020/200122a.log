========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Power was off at the start of the shift, power back on around 7:30 pm.</p>

<p>-Kevin Nicol called out to help with starting of the plant.</p>

<p>-Got all compression running except k-202, acid gas compressor and the C3b, everytime we tried starting something with high power demand we would get a power bump and it would effect all the plants in the area.</p>

<p>-Fortis says the they had some damage at the Cynthia terminal and the power out in this area got redirected to a different grid and we are at the end of the line causing the power disruptions.</p>

<p>-Tried starting the c3 and it would not run due to not enough power, it was decided to leave everything down for the night instead of selling wet.</p>

<p>-Changed 2 sets of amine bag filters.</p>

<p>-Started the volcano boiler.</p>

<p>Low voltage power from the lodgepole substation resulting in the plant staying down.&nbsp;Hi voltage power came back on around 5 PM.</p>

<p>Fired up the plant around 4 PM and started selling and waited for the go ahead from Fortis to fire up the refridge compressor.</p>

<p>K-202 down due to suspected valve issues. Down at shift change. Once its back up sour&nbsp;LP inlets can be opened. Kim Brotzel with Obsidian asked to be notified.</p>

<p>HVO delivered 2 loads of Mancal and 2 loads of Baccalieu emulsion.</p>

<p>Superior delivered propane.</p>

<p>KPA delivered 1.5 m3 of 80/20 glycol.</p>

<p>Called Rimby and got them to kick the LPG pumps back on now that we are making LPG.</p>
