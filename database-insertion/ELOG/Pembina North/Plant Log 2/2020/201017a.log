========================================
<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers and lowered tarps abit on trim cooler.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed fan to &quot;fast&quot; and turned the single speed off on the refridge condencer cooler to raise contactor inlet temp and raise c3 accumulator pressure.</p>

<p>Pinched K-201 and K-202 louvers slightly.</p>

<p>Blocked the louver in to allow hot discharge air to blow inside the building on the sullair compressor to raise the building temp.</p>

<p>Raised the setpoint on the recirc/ambiant recycle louvers on the trim cooler from 15 to 20 degrees.</p>

<p>Closed up some windows and vents throughout the plant.</p>

<p>Raised the temp setpoint a couple degrees on the Volcano heater.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 and de eth overhead suction scrubber.</p>

<p>WO#37807 for V-200 lights burnt out.</p>

<p>K-103 went down on 2nd stg disch pressure. Looked through trends and seen that 2nd stg disch temp was climbing up also. Fired up compressor and did a pressure survey&nbsp;across cooler bank and determined there was a restriction. Closed manual louvers in cooler bank to warm up final dish temp and recycled hot gas through cooler. Originally running around 5700 KPA @ 18 degrees, currently have temp running at 32 degrees.&nbsp;Found louvers for final discharge temp not controlling and wide open. With louvers not controlling and the manual louvers closed the final disch temp is too hot and with manual louvers 1 notch open disch temp runs too cold. Romeo haywired them in between the 1st and 2nd notch until louvers get fixed. Will have to call Devin out today for it.&nbsp;WO#37808.</p>

<p>Checked on the glycol injection union hourly. All good, no leaks.</p>

<p>Raised the level in the glycol flash tank back up slightly as it was running at 1 bolt.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine skim tank and dumped.</p>

<p>Lowered the debute fan speed to 10%.</p>
