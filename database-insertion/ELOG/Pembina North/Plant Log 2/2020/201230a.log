<p>Pumped down drain tank under Amine building.</p>

<p>Lowered level in Amine skim tank</p>

<p>Shipping tank pumped down, put recycle &quot;B&quot; pump in overflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; PPL kicked on and pumped down, density was 777.</p>

<p>- Manually dumped K-203/204 suction scrubbers.</p>

<p>- Perry pigged the southwest 8&quot; to 5-21, sent the pig at 9:00AM, liquids came in around 12:00AM</p>

<p>- Pembina started pumping at 8:00AM, pumped us down from 3.9m to 2.8m, density was hanging around 778-779 started pumping again at 2:00PM, went down on low density at 4:30PM.</p>

<p>- Nelson Bros brought in a load of R.O Water.</p>

<p>- Level in the reboiler has slowly been increasing, did an amine titration and the concentration is 34%, lowered the makeup water pump from 19 to 16 to try and maintain the level.</p>

<p>- Swung the exchanger back into service on TR-101 while V-3101 was dumping hard to take pressure off the boot and help keep the treater up to temperature.</p>

<p>- Kim with Obsidian pigged 1-21, pig pulled.</p>

<p>- Added 2 barrels of sun oil to the hot oil surge tank.</p>

<p>- 2-7 ESD rang in as closed, but is in travel, notified Perry, said he would pump it up on his way home, also said there is a workorder in on it to have it repaired.</p>
