========================================
<p>Sanitize control room.</p>

<p>Chris N came and repaired the broken belts off K-201 water pump.&nbsp; WO#37582.</p>

<p>Devin went through the DCS to see why K-201 didn&#39;t shut down.&nbsp; Found a hold out in the logic that should have never even let the compressor to start.&nbsp; Undid the hold out and verified unit would shut down by running the compressor depressuring the jacket water shut down the unit shut down.</p>

<p>Started up K-201, put back online.</p>

<p>Submitted MITS for k-201 incident.</p>

<p>Added propane to surge tank, from 1 bolt to 10 bolts.</p>

<p>Put recycle back into production tank.</p>

<p>Pizza meeting today.</p>
