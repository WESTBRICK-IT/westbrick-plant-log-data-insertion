========================================
<p>Sanitized control room PM and PM.</p>

<p>Hourly checks on glycol injection line. All good, no drips.</p>

<p>AIT-3101 h2s head rang in again. Tested with monitor. Verified reading was false. WO#37837.</p>

<p>Monitored K-201 engine and compressor oil level after Kenco work. Maintaining.</p>

<p>Sales h2s analyzer is saying &quot;bypassed&quot; in the little box beside the alarm banner. But the h2s-4100-BP faceplate is saying normal. Verified it was not bypassed on the analyzer itself. Will have to get Devin to look at it when he is fixing the low tape alarm.</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>Manually drained de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Increased the makeup water pump from 15 to 18 to maintain the reboiler level and concentration as the reboiler level has been dropping over the past few days.</p>
