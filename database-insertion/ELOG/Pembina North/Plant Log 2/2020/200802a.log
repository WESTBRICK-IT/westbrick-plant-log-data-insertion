<p>Process Glycol Level dropped out.&nbsp; Glycol flash tank level out the top of the top siteglass.&nbsp; Opened bypass around filters (Not showing any DP), didn&#39;t appear to help.&nbsp; Opened bottom feed to reboiler and level came back quick.&nbsp; Back to normal operations.&nbsp; Also added 30% level to surge tank from overhead.</p>

<p>Lowered Glycol flow to 5.2 roots, left in manual.</p>

<p>Amine level in reboiler down to 23% (2 bolts).&nbsp; Skimmed glycol charcoal filter X3, Amine dirty.&nbsp; Took amine tri-tration (sample a little dirty), 40%.&nbsp; Added 3 shots of amine from overhead tank and Increased amine make-up water to 50% from 20%.&nbsp; Level up to 41% at shift change.&nbsp; Will take another tri-tration next shift.</p>

<p>Lowered tops temp controller to 35%, left in manual.</p>
