========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Curtis and Avalanch integrity was out doing UT on suction scrubber&nbsp;float columes &nbsp;K-202, 208, 201 and 203. They will be out again tomorrow to do some on the c3 compression.</p>

<p>-K-202 down on high discharge 1st stage.</p>

<p>-Lowered v-200 inlet control from 320 down to 275 kpa and lowered V-200 back pressure to 250 from 290 kpa to maybe help with the pressure swing when a well kicks on out in the field.</p>

<p>-Mancal will be starting their sour 1-15 well that ties into the splitter line, they have doubled the scavanger injection rate and will be testing before flowing to us.</p>

<p>-Pollard was out and finished up on the hot oil heater insulating and will be back to tomorrow to work in the chiller piping.</p>

<p>-Spred gravel in the battery, filled the washout by the bullet with the skid steer.</p>

<p>-Apec&#39;s and Chris Nagy working on both C3 compressors.</p>

<p>-Ordered bulk methanol through Rob Thirsk</p>

<p>-A new set of water sample from Exova came in again.</p>

<p>-Added an new tab on elog for water samples.</p>

<p>-Csm out to pick up compressor parts.</p>
