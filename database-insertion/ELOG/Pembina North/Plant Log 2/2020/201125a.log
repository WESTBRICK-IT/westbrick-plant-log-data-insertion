========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Added c3 to the accumulator.</p>

<p>Ordered process water. Should have 7m3 for tomorrow early afternoon.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Both c3 condencer fans running, 2 speed was on slow. Turned off the single speed fan and turned the 2 speed to &quot;fast&quot; later in the afternoon due to cooler ambiant temps to warm up the contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 top and bottom louver temp from 38 to 34 degrees.</p>

<p>TGD audit meeting this afternoon.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump out of the&nbsp;overflow&nbsp;tank and put both into the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Driven delivered supplies and filters.</p>

<p>Sped up de bute overhead fans from 40 to 50% to lower debute pressure.</p>

<p>Added oil to LPG pump lubricator.</p>

<p>Refridge compressor (c3 &quot;b&quot;) alarmed on Brandon and Tyson for motor vibration. Our vibration transmitter did not read anything as it does not read a frequncy that high. Tyson looked into it. Didnt notice anything out of the ordinary. Called electricians out to grease the motor to see if that would help. Vibration dropped back down before they arrived and stayed low. They greased it anyways.</p>

<p>Mock ERP tomorrow.</p>

<p>Measurement inc proved V-101 liquid meter.</p>

<p>Perry pigged 5-21 North line.</p>

<p>Wade with Obsidian shut in 11-22 well to V-207 overnight due to production being abit low.</p>
