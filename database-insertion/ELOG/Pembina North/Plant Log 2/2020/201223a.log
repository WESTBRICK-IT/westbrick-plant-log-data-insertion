========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Opened up louvers on K-202 compressor.</p>

<p>Turned off the 2 speed condencer fan and turned on the single speed to cool dopwn the contactor inlet temp and lower the surge tank pressure.</p>

<p>Replaced packing on the North EG injection pump.</p>

<p>Replaced mechanical seal on both hot oil pumps.</p>

<p>Hot oil heater down on low flow when switching circ pumps. Swapped again with low flow bypass on and still lost heater. Assuming the local low flow switch is the onlyu bypass that works. Will look into it tomorrow with Devin.</p>

<p>Had issues getting the hot oil heater to fire back up as it kept going down on flame fail. Fire eye lens wiped off. No luck. Dialed up piolet gas regulator abit and it took off.</p>

<p>Shut in sour inlets while heater was down and notified producers.</p>

<p>Perry sent the 7-7 to 5-21 pig.</p>

<p>Nightshift, can you keep a close eye on the hot oil circ pump mechanical seals and watch for any leaks plase.</p>
