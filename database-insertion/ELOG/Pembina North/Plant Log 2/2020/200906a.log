========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Changed the amine charcoal filters. Sampled downs stream. Bubble test was good, but&nbsp;getting a slight skim of hydrocarbon on the sample. Also getting about 1/2 L of hydrocarbon every 12 hours off the filter pot. Flash tank, reboiler, contactor and reflux accum all looking clean. Blew down sight glasses and verified.</p>

<p>Empties some used rag bins and got rif of old filters in filter cart.</p>

<p>Recicved 7.5 m3 of makeup water from Nelson Bros/ Braz River. Filled the main tank and added the rest into the new second tank.</p>

<p>Talked to Chad at Bigoray and he said he will send some extra amine bag and charcoal filters over with one of the feild guys as they have lots. We are now out of 636-CAC charcoal filters but Zeta and Bigoray have some.</p>

<p>Slightly raised the level in the glycol flash tank as it has been slowly dropping the past few days. Got it to control around 2 bolts.</p>

<p>Turned the 2 speed refridge condencer fan from &quot;fast&quot; to &quot;slow&quot; as the accumulator pressure was getting low.</p>

<p>Lowered K-203 top and bottom louver temp control from 40 to 38 degrees to lower the contactor inlet temp. As contactor inlet started to warm up after slowing down the condencer/res gas cooler fans.</p>

<p>Closed up some doors due to rain.</p>

<p>Raised the LP to boot makeup pressure on K-202. It was hanging around -6 kpa. Raised to maintain around 2 kpa.</p>

<p>Lowered the chiller level controller from 12% to 11.5% to maintain the 3 to 5 degree temp diff. It got down to around 2.6 degrees. Kept an eye on it after and it maintained from 3.2 to 4.5 degrees.</p>

<p>Worked on weekend checks.</p>

<p>Pumped up acid gas well ESD&#39;s.</p>

<p>Topped up LPG packing lubricator canister.</p>

<p>Recycled from the boot.</p>
