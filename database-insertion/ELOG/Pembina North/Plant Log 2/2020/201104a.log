========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Cleaned up around plant. Moved one air trailer to the water plant and the other to K-207 storage. Moved the skid steer to the ambulance shack so it is no longer being cold started. Fuel skid trailer moved from the barrel warehouse to allow more room for the Gators.</p>

<p>Got a gravel truck load dumped into the washout at the 3-27 water well entrance. Will have to spread it out with the skid steer.</p>

<p>Changed the amine bag filter.</p>

<p>16-34 line pigged, batched and purged into the 5-21 line and has been suspended today. Kenny will work on the 12 KM stretch tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hi flow and GGT will be out tomorrow to prove the mass flow meter.</p>

<p>Manually dumped the de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Changed Keyera flag.</p>
