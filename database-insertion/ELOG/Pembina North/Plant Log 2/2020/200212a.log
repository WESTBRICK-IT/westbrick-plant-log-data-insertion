========================================
<p>&nbsp;At 1900 we had a power outage for 3 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortis was out to repair the issue (did not hear what it was).&nbsp; All 3 plant down.</p>

<p>Tried to isolate to minimze flareing.&nbsp; Plant still went into mode 1.</p>

<p>Dropped tarps on Amine trim cooler to keep the heat in the best we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjusted back once up and running.</p>

<p>Called out Kevin T, and Devin to help with issues bringing plants back up.</p>

<p>Ran generator while plant was down, no issues.</p>

<p>Coming back up, Devin was needed for V-103 inlet valve not actuating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>K-202 had lots of fluids and high leveled the scrubbers several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also down on start up on low lube flow, reset pop valve and ran good after.</p>

<p>Contacted producers once up and running.</p>

<p>Flaring a little bit, I cann&#39;t find where its coming from.</p>

<p>De Eth reflux pump seals leaked, isolated and ran other pump.&nbsp;&nbsp; WO# 35490 for new seals.</p>

<p>Pumped up ESD at Acid gas well.</p>
