========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Sanitized the control room.</p>

<p>-Tightened the packing on the north eg pump.</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter. Very little oil</p>

<p>-K202 Forth stage scrubber dump alarming that the dump was open to long. Changed the dump setting to open at 20% from 25% and close at 15%. This was to shorten the dump cycle. Was good after the change.</p>

<p>-Closed the louvers a little on K202 compressor to help condense less liquids in the 4th stage scrubber.</p>

<p>-Started the single speed c3 fan and swapped the 2 speed fan from fast to slow.</p>
