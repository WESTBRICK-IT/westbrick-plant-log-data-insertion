<p>&nbsp;-Sanitized the control room.</p>

<p>-Tyson did a walk trough of the plant.</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter, about 1/2 liter of oil.</p>

<p>-Started the 2 speed c3 fan to slow.</p>

<p>-HVO delivered a load of Mancal emulsion, 2 drivers and both needed orientations.</p>

<p>-Added a little glycol to the regen from the overhead tank.</p>

<p>-Cleaned up soaker pads and rags in the compressor building.</p>

<p>-Sales analyzer tape has about an inch of tape left on it.</p>

<p>-V-207 did not have any liquid production in todays books, looked back at the trend and it looks like it dumped a few times, went down and manually dumped the separator, stroked the dump a few times and started getting a flow rate. Will see how the production looks tomorrow.</p>

<p>-Added oil to the LPG packing lubricators and adjusted the lube rates.</p>

<p>-K-203 started fluctuating between 850 and 890 RPM, then started detonating, notified Tyson T. and he found a bad lead to one of the cylinders, replaced and also adjusted the timing.</p>

<p>-Tyson also added some oil to K-203 engine also marked the level after adding, the level in the sightglass has been slowly dropping but the kenco has only been adding 1 to 2 litres per day. sent in a workorder to have the kenco looked at, WO#37998.</p>

<p>-Pumped out the compressor underground packing drain tanks.</p>

<p>-Tightened the packing on recycle pump &quot;A&quot;.</p>

<p>-Tightened the packing on V-207 dump valve.</p>

<p>-Pumped out the amine pump packing tank.</p>
