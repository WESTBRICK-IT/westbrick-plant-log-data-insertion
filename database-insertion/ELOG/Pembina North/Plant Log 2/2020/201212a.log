========================================
<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-202 1st and 2nd stg scrubber and de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Slowed down debute fans by 10%.</p>

<p>Did not get any slugs from 5-21 pig. Dump flow rate trend cycle tightened up abit around shift change. Assuming that was when it arrived.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter. Light skim of oil.</p>

<p>Unpacked stuff from boot room into the ambulance shack. Will do more tomorrow.</p>

<p>Laid some fresh soaker pads at K-206.</p>

<p>Pumped out water plant floor drain.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>5-21 pig came in around 19:00 PM. Lots of liquids for about 2 hours.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber and K-202 1st and 2nd stg scrubbers.</p>

<p>HP cold sep dump line restricted earlier today. Raised temp on glycol reboiler a little. was originally 116-117 now at 119.</p>

<p>Outside temps cooled down quite abit. around -23 degrees.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on K-201 and K-202 to warm up contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Turned the&nbsp;single speed condencer fan off and turned the 2 speed fan on &quot;slow&quot; to raise accumulator pressure and contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Pembina called around 21:00 PM. Low density rang in and shut us down. This was shortly after the pig arrived so assuming lots of light liquids swept in. Sped up both recycle pumps to 95%&nbsp;in hopes of rasing the density. She tried again at 1 am and still no luck. She said we can call anytime and they will try again.</p>

<p>Lowered chiller level from 9.5% to 9% to stay within the 3-5 degree tempature differential.</p>

<p>Pinched internal louvers on K-203 as both top and bottom louver controllers were at zero and not maintaining set point and contactor inlet was starting to drop down.</p>

<p>Pinched louvers on the acid gas compressor as the recirc louvers were wide open and not maintaining temp.</p>

<p>Pinched South West trim cooler louvers 1 notch.</p>

<p>Put emission tank pump in service and pumped down the reclimation tank.</p>
