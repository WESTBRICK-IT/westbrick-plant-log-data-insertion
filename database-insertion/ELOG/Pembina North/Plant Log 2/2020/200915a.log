========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Sanitized the control room</p>

<p>-Boss&nbsp;Energy Managment&nbsp;was out to remove the liner in the hydrovac soil pit and mounded the soil up for it to dry out.</p>

<p>-Filled the lpg pump lubricator.</p>

<p>-Skimmed the amine charcoal filter.</p>

<p>-Pumped the glycol drip&nbsp;barrel back into the regen.</p>

<p>-Tightened the eg pump packings.</p>

<p>-Changed some soaker pads around the hot oil pumps</p>

<p>-Drained some lube oil off the chiller.</p>

<p>-Put a platform to stand&nbsp;by the glycol&nbsp;emmisions tank&nbsp;so we can dump the glycol pump drip pail into the funnel instead of using the barrel.</p>

<p>-Nathan was out trouble shooting the lel head issues in process.</p>
