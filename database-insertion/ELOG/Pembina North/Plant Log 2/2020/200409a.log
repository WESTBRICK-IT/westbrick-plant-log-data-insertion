========================================
<p>Shut off the 2 speed condencer fan and turned the 2 speed fan from slow to fast to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Increased K-203 top and bottom louver temp controller from 35 to 37 degrees to warm up contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Opened V-101 gas off back through FQI-99 as per dayshift.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler.</p>

<p>K-206 engine PCV vent 1&#39;&#39; tubing line came off at the fitting where it ties in to the air intake line. Fitting was loose and popped off. Re-installed and tightened. All good.</p>

<p>Sanitized control room PM and AM.</p>

<p>Finished off all time sensitive CMDS modules. Caught up for now.</p>

<p>New Vermilion well must have kicked hard around 03:20 AM as V-3101 rang in hi level and 14-03 line pressure increased. Manually pinched inlet valve until 3101 upper barrel level emtied then let the inlet slug control take over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Warmer weather had to open a bunch of stuff up.</p>

<p>Devin and Kevin installed a new level transmitter on K-202, level can be adjusted on the K-202 panel screen.</p>

<p>Brought K-202 back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn&#39;t want to start needed to shut the fuel gas off to it and feather it open while Jordy was cranking it over.</p>

<p>PPL out to look at their pump.</p>

<p>Rob hauled 4 loads of Zeta water.&nbsp; *Could night shift please keep the big pump going as long as possible as there are more loads coming in tomorrow.*</p>

<p>Turned the other C3 condenser fan on.</p>

<p>Raised tarps on the Amine trim cooler.</p>

<p>Closed louvers on the North side of plenum due to getting warm in there.</p>

<p>Lowered K-204 louver temps to 35 from 40 degrees.</p>

<p>Shut down K-208.&nbsp; Blew down scrubbers</p>

<p>Turned up the debute fan to 30%</p>

<p>Sanitized the control room 2x</p>

<p>Devin checked orifice plate on V-101.&nbsp; plate was backwards.&nbsp; all good now.</p>

<p>Reset Wonderware to update changes on K-202.</p>
