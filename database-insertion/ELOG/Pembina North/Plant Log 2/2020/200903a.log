========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Tyson repaired both amine pumps. P-4750 has new packing and P-4700 has new lip seals. Ran them both and verified they werent leaking. Left P-4750 in service. Please keep an eye on it. Packing may need to be tightened up as it breaks in.</p>

<p>Bob Koetler out to take soil samples of the vac pit. Once samples pass the pit can be partially removed.</p>

<p>Nathan doing motor greasing and MCC inspections etc.</p>

<p>Tyson did a plant walkthrough.</p>

<p>Skid steer work arounf the LPG building area fixing up ground and drainage issues.</p>

<p>Rob delivered methanol to Zeta Creek and Pembina North and hauled some water.</p>

<p>Skimmed off the hydrocarbon in the amine skim tank.</p>

<p>All Pro valve on site to grease Keylink valves. Turns out none of them at Pem and Braz are servicable. Got them to service V-107 inlet ESD at it wasnt holding. Seems to hold now after greasing.</p>

<p>Checked polymere vent. All good.</p>

<p>Drained the water plant sulfatreat scrubber.</p>

<p>Recycled off the overflow tank until it rang in low level. Both pumps now in the shipping tank.</p>
