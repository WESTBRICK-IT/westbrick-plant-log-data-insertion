<p><strong>***Running Braz remotly most of the day remotely due to ambiant temps, Slowed K-103 way down and cut suction. Was originally at 1100 rpm and 640 kps suction. Cut refridge suction way back as well. Lost K-102 on 4th stg disch temp, opened up shallow cut recycle 1/4 turn to cool down. Nightshift may need to cut back slightly if 101/102 suction temps are too cool. Fighting with V-300 wax, blew down handful of times***</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both methanol pumps seized up. Sprayed WD-40 down air line. Also repaired arm on micro-switch as the set skrew backed off. Please continue to keep a close eye on them. (notified Perry of the outage).</p>

<p>HVO hauled in 4 loads of Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Rob hauled in Zeta water and sucked out process floor drains.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the overflow tank.</p>

<p>Worked on the master action item list.</p>

<p>Nightshift truck is ready. We will pick up tonight and deliver it to the plant in the AM.</p>

<p>FYI- We ordered analyzer tape from MRC yesterday and it will be delivered Wednesday.</p>

<p>Reflux pumps have continued to behave even with the hot weather. Cooler temp is still really hot but not swinging like it was. Adjusted reboiler temp to 21% to maintain around 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Started weekend checks.</p>

<p>Inspected polymere vent.</p>
