<p>The water disposal pump P-10 was hammering this morning once in reached around 4300KPA discharge pressure, shut down the pump, pulled and cleaned the Y-Strainer upstream of booster pumps, there was just a few small chunks of wax on it, also had Tyson check pulsation dampener pressures on suction and discharge. He increased the discharge pressure to 800PSI from 780PSI. Monitored the pump throughout the day.</p>

<p>MP header chemical pump was leaking a bit, pump is shut down and blocked in, Devin N. ordered parts for repair.</p>

<p>Sump pump in the water plant is not pumping, Tyson will repair tomorrow, Rob sucked out the sump for the time being.</p>
