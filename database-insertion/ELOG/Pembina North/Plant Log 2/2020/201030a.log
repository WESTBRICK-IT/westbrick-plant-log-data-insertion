========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Manaully dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Manually dumped amine skim tank.</p>

<p>Lost K-203 compressor. JW level was fairly low after water pump swap. Filled up expansion tank. No issues.</p>

<p>Equalized the production and the overflow tank to lower the level in the shipping tank.</p>

<p>Got Core Labs sample back from our sales oil. It was a pass but now Pembina is enforcing their density spec of 790 minumum. They will pump us down for the night as long as we can hang around 788 and higher. If the shipping tank gets low, swing one pump to the overflow tank and recycle it slowly.</p>

<p>Started a few weekend checks.</p>

<p>Recevied a load of R/O water from Nelson Bros.</p>

<p>Dumped k203 suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Home hardware delivered drinking H2O.</p>
