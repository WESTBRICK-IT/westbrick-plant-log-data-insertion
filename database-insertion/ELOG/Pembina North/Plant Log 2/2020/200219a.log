========================================
<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Closed louvers on K-208 compressor.</p>

<p>Blew down and cleaned TR-101 front and back water sight glasses.</p>

<p>Worked on procedures.</p>

<p>Dayshift, can you line up getting the nightshift truck hauled away and sent in to get looked at. Truck turns over but will not fire, seems like a fuel pump issue. Have used Kelly&#39;s trucking with a 1 ton and gooseneck with a winch in the past.</p>

<p>Blew down chiller de-oiler. Will need to get Rob to suck out the holding tank. Its pretty full.</p>

<p>Skimmed the amine charcoal filter. Clean.</p>

<p>K-208 boot scrubber pump having a hard time pumping. 1st stg suct press was 8 kpa. Added fuel gas to scrubber to get it to pump. Noticed afterwards the valve on the recycle tubing line off the disch to prevent vapour locking was closed. Not sure why. Re-opened which should help. Keep an eye for leaks.</p>
