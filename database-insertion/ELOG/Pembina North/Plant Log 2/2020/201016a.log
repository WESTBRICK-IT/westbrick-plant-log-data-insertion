========================================
<p>&nbsp;-Sanitized the control room</p>

<p>-Added c3 to the surge tank.</p>

<p>-Phoned producer about the plant outtage on Thursday.</p>

<p>-Pumped out the amine packing drain tank</p>

<p>-Perry Pigged 14-3 line, very little liquids. Pig was pulled clean.</p>

<p>-Brandon called to inquire about a vibration alarm he got from BC3. Looking back on the trends the only thing we could find was we got a slug&nbsp;of Vermillian gas&nbsp;into V-101 around the same time as the vibration alarm.</p>

<p>-Filled the lpg lubricator</p>
