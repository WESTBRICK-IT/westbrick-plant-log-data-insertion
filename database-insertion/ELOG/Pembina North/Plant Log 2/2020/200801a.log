<p>Plant steady.</p>

<p>Glycol flash tank level won&#39;t drop. No DP in filter but when we swang the north pot, level drops slowly. Changed out south filter, plugged with carbon charcoal. Checked sensing line and no restriction on both sides. Started alarming again on shift change. Switch filter pot. South filter online.</p>

<p>Acid gas 2nd stage suction scrubber alarmed on high level. Open up downstream of control valve. Open up 1st stage suction scrubber pump discharge line underneath the grading.</p>

<p>Overflow tank alarmed low level. Switch both pumps into production.</p>

<p>Skimmed amine charcoal filter, good.</p>

<p>Sent work order for electrician to check LEL head in the process building. WO#-37251</p>
