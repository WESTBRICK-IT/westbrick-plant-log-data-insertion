========================================
<p>Amine plant- Skimmed amine reboiler, then contactor, the flash tank &amp; regen tower, all set points back to normal.</p>

<p>Amine skim tank still high leveled, need to test amine underground, before dumping the skim to see if it is worth saving skimmed amine. Flared off any hydrocarbon already, may settle out some more in the skim tank</p>

<p>Prep for spool change in the inlet header building tomorrow, depressured piping from 1-21 to the sales/splitter area to inlet header to save some time tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Daren &amp; Mark working on comms for the water plant</p>

<p>Devin N- H2S anylizer pm&#39;s sales &amp; process, flare meter pm&#39;s</p>

<p>Horizontal coalessor liquid dump control valve passed, looked at it with Devin, he will source parts or replacement, new may be cheaper. WIll require MOC if we go new.</p>
