<p>Wednesday morning meeting.</p>

<p>14-03 line pigged and batched. Lots of fluid.</p>

<p>Shutdown K-206 due to cyl 2 left bank not firing. Founch a cracked spark plug.</p>

<p>Adjusted de bute overhead fans as needed.</p>

<p>Chiller level set to 10% to maintain the 3 to 5 degree tempature differential span.</p>

<p>Kevin grabbed the empty nitrogen bottles and took them up to Braz for pick up tomorrow.</p>

<p>Swung recycle pump &quot;B&quot; into the production tank.</p>

<p>Pembina shut us down due to the density being to low and vapour pressure being too high. May have to equalize tanks tonight or tomorrow and recycle as much as possible from the shipping tank through the treater to flash off the light ends.</p>

<p>Nightshift can you increase the treater temp 3 degrees. As per Kelly.</p>
