========================================
<p>Finish bringing WPNE on after power bump</p>

<p>Open up and bring on Obsidian wells via V-200</p>

<p>Called Rimbey for LPG start</p>

<p>Increase Amine boiler valve from 25% to 27%. OVHD&#39;s temp holding asround 100C</p>

<p>Call Tye for info on Braz analyzers, they started to spike and the trend looked like they are failing. Devin is working on.</p>

<p>Gas/Gas exchangers showing some higher DP through night. Has been dropping slowly, will pass along to dayshift for possible methanol.</p>

========================================
<p>-Wednesday morning meeting.</p>

<p>-Alex with Core Lab out to take monthly gas/condy samples.</p>

<p>-Brad with cathodic solutions working out in the field on the WPNE pipeline.</p>

<p>-Amine concentration is at 43.7%, left the makeup pump at 15.</p>

<p>-Raised the southwest and southeast tarps on the amine trim cooler.</p>

<p>-Lowered the top louver control setpoint on K-203 from 40 to 39 to lower the temperature into the contactor.</p>

<p>-Tyson and Kevin T. worked on C3A compressor, removed piston and wiper from cylinder #6, sent it into CSM for repair.</p>

<p>-Cleaned the treater exchanger basket twice, filled with small hard chunks of wax, suspecting V-200.</p>

<p>-Cycled methanol once through the gas/gas exchanger once, seeing if it would drop the d/p on the exchanger, didnt seem to make a difference, pressure has been up and down throughout the day, will discuss with Daren tomorrow and see if the guages need to be proved.</p>

<p>-Changed water plant filters (West Pot), east pot is now in service.</p>

<p>-Rob hauled in Braz produced water.</p>

<p>-Dallas submitted a onestop flare notification to the AER due to the duration and amount of gas that was flared yesterday, had issues submitting the report, &quot;Error submitting notification #1783209&quot; , tried to contact AER help desk, unable to get ahold of them.</p>

<p>-Lean Glycol concentration was at 77.6%, Bumped up the temperature in the glycol reboiler from 116 to 118 degrees.</p>
