========================================
<p>Inlet temp to the contactor started to cool off fairly fast. Looked over compressor coolers and noticed the internal recycle louvers on the south side of K-203 were closed and the top horizontal set were wide open. climed up top and adjusted the linkage and got the tops closed and the internals open. Warmed up 20 degrees on the compressor bank temps and 7 degrees on the inlet. Set the louver temps to 46 degrees to maintian around 31 degrees on the contactor inlet.</p>

<p>Added c3 to the refridge accumulator.</p>

<p>8-24 ESD status rang in. Differential pressure is fine. Valve is in travel. Dayshift can you notify field op please.</p>

<p>Spare truck having a hard time keeping charge. Put battery charger on it for the night then parked it in K-207 storage to keep warm.</p>

<p>Slowed down the water makeup pump from 23 to 10 to prevent it from emtying the storage tank and freezing off injection line to the reboiler. Water supposed to be delivered this AM and pump can be turned back up after.</p>

<p>Opened up the tarp abit on the amine trim cooler to get the overhead louvers to pinch abit and hold more heat in the cooler and bring the recycle temp up.</p>

<p>Gas flows up and down again by 200 e3m3.</p>

<p>C3 compressor maintained glycol level.</p>
