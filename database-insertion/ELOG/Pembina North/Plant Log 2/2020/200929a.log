========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Opened up V-107 inlet to split flow the splitter.</p>

<p>Pinched K-202 louvers 2 notches to warm up 4th stg suct abit. Louvers are just over half way opened.</p>

<p>Nelson Bros delivered 6.5 m3 of process water.</p>

<p>Glen with GGT topped up our methanol tank with left over methanol from Bigoray.</p>

<p>Fired up volcano heater to ensure it is ready for use. Lowered temp setpoint to 60 degrees from 85. Walked the pipe rack numerous times to look for any leaks. Nightshift, can you keep an eye on surge tank level etc. Will probably shut it down tomorrow.</p>

<p>Swung both recycle pumps into the production tank.</p>

<p>Erik and Dustin the Keabry scoping out R/O water skid tie in points.</p>

<p>Lost K-202. First out looked like low jacket water pressure. Fired back up and JW pressure was 80 KPA higher than alarm point and belts looked all good.</p>

<p>Lost volcano heater as it overshot its temp setpoint by 7 degrees. Temp controller looked to be in manual. Set to auto and bumped up temp setpoint to 70 degrees. Nightshift, please monitor.</p>
