========================================
<p>-Shut down C3-B for Tyson to pull doors and inspect connecting rods on cylinder 1 and 2, found some scarring.</p>

<p>-Nelson Bros delivered some amine make up water, increased the makeup pump from 10 to 15.</p>

<p>-Rob hauled in Braz and Zeta produced water.</p>

<p>-V-101 and V-103 ESD&#39;d.</p>

<p>-Shut in all sour production as soon as power surge happened (WPNA / PNA / 5-14), plant went sour shortly after everything shut down, lost K-205 after sales ESD closed, did not sour up TCPL.</p>

<p>-Tye came down from Braz to assist, we had issues trying to pull back on the line from K-205 discharge, found there was a faceplate PIC-207 (K-205 Recycle) that was not functioning, had Daren fix it.</p>

<p>-Once sweetened back up, started and loaded K-205, started K-5000,&nbsp; Started opening inlets back up, V-101, V-103 fully opened and&nbsp; slowly bringing on 5-14, PNA, WPNA.</p>
