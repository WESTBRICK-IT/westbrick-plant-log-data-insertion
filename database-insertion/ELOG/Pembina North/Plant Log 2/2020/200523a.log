========================================
<p>Sanitized control room 2x</p>

<p>Weekend checks.</p>

<p>Rob hauled Braz water and sucked out sumps in process, and the temporary methanol tank secondary.</p>

<p>Checked methanol rates, all good.</p>

<p>Vermilion pigged the 9-16 line, brought in a lot of hydrate material and plugged off dump line y screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulled sreen and injected some methanol freed up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you to Dayton for watching screens while we were busy.</p>

<p>Contacted Vermilion about it and they shut their methanol pumps off at the end of March and has a history of hydrates.&nbsp;&nbsp; They went back and turned the pumps back on.</p>

<p>Acid gas compressor 3rd stage level high level rang in, drained the level and isolated the dump off the sep to the water flash tank to see if thats where it was coming back from.</p>

<p>Topped up Methanol tank.</p>
