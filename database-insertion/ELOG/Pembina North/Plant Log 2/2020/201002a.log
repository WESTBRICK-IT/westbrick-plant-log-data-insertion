========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>Hung do not enter signs on on out of service tanks in tank farm.</p>

<p>Tyson tightened packings on water injection pump.</p>

<p>Marty hauled in zeta water and sucked bottoms off the used lube oil tank.</p>

<p>Worked on clean up list.</p>

<p>HP cold sep level not maintaining as steady as ususal and valve position opening more and more. Stroked valve and left wide open but it was only dumping enough to maintain level. Cycled methanol pump through dump valve and the level began to drop off. The level is slowly coming back up. Please keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Added a LIC-3106 HP cold sep level trend to the process trends page FYI.</p>

<p>V-104 seperator not making a level. Most likely passing through valve or not registering a flow rate. Blocked in the dump line to build level and verify.</p>

<p>Volcano flow boss power was out. Kristina plugged back in.</p>

<p>Sped up the 2 speed condencer fan to &quot;fast&quot; lower surge tank pressure and to lower contactor inlet temp.</p>

<p>Smelled a sour odor from K-202 1st stage discharge bottle. Leaking fitting found for connecting vent hose. Shutdown and replaced with a plug. Notified Raymond. MITS#18629 submitted.</p>

<p>Manually dumped K-204 suction scrubbers.</p>
