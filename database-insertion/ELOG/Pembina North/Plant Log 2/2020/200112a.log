========================================
<p>Blocked in sensing line for K-206 2nd stg suction pressure to replace leaking guage on top of suction bottle. Compressor down due to low suction pressure. Replaced guage and fired back up.</p>

<p>K-202 discharge temps were around 20 degrees. Closed the louvers to the last notch but jacket water and oil temps get too high. One notch open is too much. Have the louvers set in between the 2 notches and raised the discharge temp setpoints 10 degrees. From 30 to 40 to try and increase contactor inlet temp. Managed to get the discharge temp up to 32 degrees but thats as warm as it gets.</p>

<p>V-101 level transmitter reading faulty. Blew it down and got it reading correctly.</p>

<p>Refridge compressor accumulator level maintained between 3.5 to 4 bolts through the night.</p>
