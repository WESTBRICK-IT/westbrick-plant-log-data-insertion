========================================
<p>Sanitized control room AM and PM.</p>

<p>K-201 down at shift change on bad valves. Chris Nagy came out first thing to replace.</p>

<p>Chris Nagy tightened packing on West amine charge pump. Keep an eye on.</p>

<p>Tightened union abit on glycol pumps. Keep an eye on.</p>

<p>TR-101 down on low level. Oil dump cycling rapidly and overshooting itself. Believe it was getting intermitent slugs from V-101, 103 and 3101 at the same time. Adjusted dump controller slightly and it started to act better. Kept an eye on it through the day and no issues.</p>

<p>Jordan with baker delivered scale inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor and PAO 1001 chemical.</p>

<p>HVO hauled in a load of Mancal oil.</p>

<p>Adjusted debute cooler fans as needed.</p>

<p>Manually dumped de eth suction scrubber.</p>

<p>Chris Nagy did a walk though the plant.</p>

<p>Programmed gate for Chris Nagys truck.</p>

<p>Worked on ADR&#39;s.</p>

<p>Dialed back the amine makeup water pump from 19 to 17.</p>

<p>Mark S sent the 5-21 Dominion pig. No slug and came in rather fast. Pig has been pulled.</p>

<p>14-03 pig will be sent tomorrow.</p>

<p>Acid gas ESD still forced open FYI.</p>

<p>Will get rob to suck out the slop drum in process next time he is out.</p>
