========================================
<p>Weather cold and rain in the am turning sunny +12 in the afternoon</p>

<p>At 7:30 am ops shot the production tank temp and 3.7 meters that matched with the level transmitter.</p>

<p>Took part in the Pembina oil outtage JHID</p>

<p>Called Pembina to confirm and was told that they will pump 40% of the plants daily noms every day of the outtage or until their tanks are full and cant take any more then it drops to 0%</p>

<p>Ops was swapping recycle valve back to production in the and open the wrong valve and equalize production back to the overflow. Swung the recycle back into the overflow to get level down so Pembina will start pumping again.</p>

<p>Bob Morrish out for a Site visit.</p>

<p>Apec did the water plant PM</p>

<p>11 new 4 head monitors arrived, assigned one to all ops and maintenance, every serial number has been recorded and the list is on Kelly&#39;s desk</p>

<p>Chris Page will be delivering bulk oil tomorrow</p>
