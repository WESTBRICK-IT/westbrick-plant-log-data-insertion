========================================
<p>Just a heads up, the seat safety switch on the skid steer is currently bypassed. Normaly the switch will apply the park brake if it does not detect any weight on the seat. However, that feature is not working and is currently jumpered. So if for some reason during operation</p>

<p>the seat does not detect any weight the park brake is NOT going to enguage. The seat belt switch works in conjunction with this and the seat belt safety switch is currently still working. If the seat belt is not worn correctly (if buckled behind your back) and you exit the skid steer</p>

<p>with the seat belt buckled the park brake will not apply and if the controls are bumped during access or egress the skid steer and or bucket/boom controls are operational and WILL move. Also, the skid steer could roll with no one operating it. Therefore, as always wear the</p>

<p>seatbelt correctly. That way un-buckling to exit the unit will enguage the park brake automatically, and hazzards will be avoided.</p>
